You get your bus pass?
I'm not going to buy one.
You're not?
I think it's a waste of money.
It actually costs less if you have a bus pass.
You can use it however many times you need to.
Yup, and you can keep the money in your pocket.
You should go get yours.
Yeah, I think I will.
I'm calling today about a bill that I never received.
Can you tell me which credit card it was for?
It was for my Master Card.
You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago.
I haven't got it in the mail yet.
The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed.
What am I supposed to do about my bill then?
Maybe you should call your post office.
But if it's their mistake, can I get an extension on my bill payment?
Yes, but you will need to send us proof of their mistake.
Thank you very much for your help.
No problem. Enjoy the rest of your day.
I was inquiring about a bill that I never got.
Which credit card was the bill for?
The bill was for my Master Card.
That bill should have been mailed about two weeks ago.
It never came in the mail.
My computer shows that it has already been mailed.
I have not gotten my bill, so what should I do about that?
You should try contacting your post office.
If it is the post office's fault, may I have an extension on my bill?
You'll have to prove it was their error; then you can get an extension.
You are very welcome. Have a good day.
I haven't received my credit card bill yet.
Which credit card are you speaking of?
My Master Card.
We sent that bill out a couple of weeks ago.
I never got it.
Your bill was mailed already.
What am I going to do since I haven't received the bill?
If you haven't gotten it yet, then you should probably take that up with your post office.
Can I get an extension on my bill if it does happen to be the post office's fault?
If that's the case, you will need to provide proof of their mistake.
Don't mention it. Call back if you have any more problems.
There's a problem with my credit card.
A charge came up on my bill that I didn't make.
What was the charge for?
The charge was for a $350 purse, but I did not buy it.
Are you sure that you didn't make that purchase?
I would know if I bought something that expensive.
I apologize. What day was this purchase made?
It was bought on November 12th at 3:15 pm, while I was at work.
All right, we'll do an investigation.
Until this investigation is finished, will I have to pay for the charge?
No, you don't. We'll take care of it.
I have a problem with my credit card.
There is a charge on my card that I didn't make.
Can you tell me what the charge was?
It's for a purse that cost $350.
Are you positive that you didn't buy the purse?
I can't even afford a purse that expensive.
I'm very sorry. When was this purchase made?
I was at work, but the purchase was made at 3:15 on November 12th.
We're going to investigate this claim.
Do I have to pay for this charge?
You won't have to pay for anything.
There is something wrong with my credit card.
There is a charge on here that I never made.
What charge was made?
It was a charge for a $350 purse that I never bought.
You didn't make this purchase?
I think I would remember if I made a purchase that large.
Sorry. When was this purse purchased?
It was purchased on the 12th of November at 3:15 pm, but I was at work.
We'll do an investigation and get to the bottom of this.
In the meantime, do I have to pay for this charge?
No. We'll take care of everything.

What kinds of packages do you offer?
We have all kinds of movie channel packages.
What else do you have?
There is a package for all sports channels.
Do you have a package that includes all the movie channels with the basic channels also?
Yes, we do offer that package.
I want that.

Inquiring about Internet Services
I would like to order some internet today.
What kind would you like?
What kind of internet is there?
You can get DSL or dial-up.
Which of those two is best?
I would recommend DSL.
Is that one better?
It's better because it doesn't tie up your phone.
DSL isn't connected through your phone line, but dial-up is.
So then I can't use my phone if I'm on the internet?
That's correct. With DSL you can do both.
I need to get internet.
Which kind of internet connection do you want to get?
What kind can I get?
There is dial-up or DSL.
Which one do you feel is best?
I would get DSL if I were you.
DSL is better than dial-up?
It's the best choice; plus, it won't tie up your phone line.
I'm not sure what that means.
Dial-up is connected through your phone, unlike DSL.
That'll make it impossible for me to use.
Exactly. With DSL you don't have that problem.
I'd like to have internet on my computer.
Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get?
What are my options?
You can either get dial-up or DSL.
Which one would you recommend?
DSL is the best choice.
Why is DSL better?
It's a lot better because it doesn't tie up your phone line.
What exactly does that mean?
Well, with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line.
That means that I can't use my phone and the internet at the same time, right?
That's right. You won't have that problem with DSL.

Have you checked the connections on your computer?
What connections?
There are cords that connect your computer to a power outlet.
Will the cords keep it from turning on?
It won't turn on if the cords aren't connected.
I didn't think of that.
Try it and see if it works.
I think that I will, thanks.
It should work, but let me know if it doesn't.
My computer isn't working.

Talking to People at the Laundromat
Have you been coming to this Laundromat long?
I have been washing clothes here since a few years ago.
It doesn't cost me as much to wash here.
I've just started doing my clothes here.
Why are you washing your clothes here now?
My washing machine broke down.
You should just pay someone to fix it.
It's too expensive to get it fixed.

How long have you been washing clothes here?
I started washing here about three years ago.
I can wash my clothes for less money here.
This is my first time washing clothes here.

So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on?
That's my only option right now.
Don't worry. Besides, it's a lot cheaper to wash clothes this way.

I'm not sure about how to operate the washer and dryer.
I need help turning them on.

There's nothing else to it.
You're welcome. Let me know if you need anything else.
I need help using the washer and dryer.
I can't figure out how to turn them on.
Do you have some quarters?
I didn't know I needed change.
The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar.

The quarters go into the slot. You have to push the slot in, and the machine will turn on.
Is that everything that I have to do?
That's all there is.
I appreciate you helping me with this.
If you need anything else, just let me know.
Could you tell me how to use the washer and dryer?

Talking with Angry Parent
Do you realize what time it is?
I'm sorry, I lost track of time.
Do you honestly believe that that is a good excuse?
Not at all--that is what really happened.
How many times do I have to ask you to call if you're going to be late?
Yes, I know. I must've forgot.
That's beside the point, you still should have called.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Next time you come in late without calling, you're gone.
You're really going to kick me out?
Yes, maybe then you'll figure out how to follow the rules.
Actually, if you kick me out, your rules won't matter anymore.
Do you have any idea what time it is?
My bad. I didn't realize that it was so late.
Do you really think that that excuses your tardiness?
Of course not. I really did lose track of time.
Didn't I tell you to call when you're running late?
Yeah, you did. I just forgot to call.
It doesn't matter, you should have called and let me know.
That's true. My bad for not calling.
If you do this again, don't even bother coming home.
You're going to kick me out over this?
Exactly, maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules.
Well, if I'm not living here anymore, then I won't have to listen to your rules.
Do you know how late it is?
My fault. I didn't realize what time it was.
I hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook.
Not really. I'm telling the truth.
Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late?
This is true, but it must've slipped my mind.
Regardless, all you had to do was give a call.
I know. I should've called.
Come home late one more time, and you'll find your stuff outside.
You want to throw me out over this?
That's right, maybe then you'll respect my rules.
That's fine, because if I leave, then your rules won't matter.
Cleaning Up the Room
Did you clean your room today?
No, not yet.
When were you planning on doing that?

Have you started cleaning up your room yet?
I haven't gotten started on my room yet.
When exactly do you plan on cleaning it?
I have every intention of cleaning my room later.
I thought I asked you to clean your room earlier.
I already told you that I'm going to do it.
Remember to vacuum the floor and dust everything.
I'll remember to do that.
Make sure that you don't go anywhere until you clean your room.
I'll clean my room before I leave.
Buying a Burrito
Man, I'm so hungry! Can you buy me a burrito?
I don't have any money to buy you a burrito.
Please? I haven't eaten anything all day.
Look, I only have money to buy myself a burrito.
I'm so hungry, I could eat a whole cow!
If you're so hungry, why don't you ask someone else for money?
I get paid on Friday, I'll pay you back then.
Well, I guess on Friday, then you can eat.
That's pretty messed up.
Why don't you just go home and eat?
I don't want to go all the way home just to eat.
Well, I guess you're out of luck.
I really want a burrito! Can you get me one?
I haven't got any money to purchase a burrito for you and me.
Would you please buy me one since I haven't eaten today?
I only have a few dollars.
I could eat a horse right now, I'm so hungry.
I want to eat too. Ask someone else to feed you.
Since I get my check this Friday, I can give you your money back then.
So then, this Friday you'll be able to eat.
You're mean to say that.
You should just go home and make yourself a sandwich or something.
My house is too far, and I'm really hungry.
It sounds as if you're going to continue starving.
I'm starving! It would be truly appreciated if you bought me a burrito.
I'm a little short. I don't have enough for you.
I'm starving, as I didn't eat yet today.
I really don't have enough money.
My stomach feels so empty.
Well, why don't you ask Bob for some money? I'm hungry too.
I'll be getting money on Friday, and I'll get it back to you then.
Okay, so on Friday, you can buy yourself something to eat.
You can always go home and make something to eat.
I can't go home yet, because I have things to do here.
Sorry. That's not my fault.
Did you feed the puppies today?
That's good! Just make sure to bathe them later.
No problem. I can do that for you.
Thank you! You know they have to go to the vet on Saturday?
I know. What time do they go?
Their appointment is at eleven o'clock in the morning.
Okay, I won't forget.
Have you given the puppies food yet?
Of course. I fed them today.
Good job! Please give them a bath later on today.
Sure, I'll give them a bath.
Thanks. But don't forget that they have a vet appointment this Saturday.
I remember. What time do they need to be there?
They need to be there at eleven in the morning.
All right. I'll make sure and remember.
Have you given the puppies anything to eat today?
I fed them earlier today.
Great! Could you please bathe them later?
Okay, I'll do that later.
Thank you! Remember that they go to the vet this Saturday.
I know. What time is their appointment?
We need to have them there at 11:00 AM.
I got it. I will remember.
What's for dinner tonight?
It's whatever you're planning on cooking.
You're not going to cook?
No, I always cook.
Yes, and I love your cooking.
Don't give me that. If you're hungry, then cook dinner.
You're being serious?
Look, I'm really tired tonight. I don't feel like cooking dinner.
I'll make dinner tonight.
Thank you. I'm going to bed.
Do you want me to wake you up when dinner is ready?
Yes, please.
What are we going to eat for dinner?
Whatever meal that you plan on making.
I thought you were making dinner tonight.
I do all the cooking.
Your food tastes so much better than mine.
Save it. If you want something to eat, then make it yourself.
You really want me to cook tonight?
I had a long day today. I really am not in the mood to make anything.
Thanks. I'm going to go take a nap.
Would you like me to come get you when the food is done?
So, what's on the menu for dinner tonight?
You tell me.
You're not going to make anything to eat?
You never cook. I always do.
I think you're a better cook than I am.
Oh please, you need to cook tonight.
So you're telling me that you want me to make dinner?
It was a hard day. Can you just do this for me tonight?
I'll cook dinner, don't worry.
I'm going to go rest for a little bit.
I'll come wake you when it's ready, okay?
Washing Clothes
Have you washed any clothes yet?
No, I've only washed my whites.
When you wash your dark clothes, can you put some of mine in?
Sure. Is there any extra care that I should take with your clothes?
Just make sure you keep it on the gentle cycle.
How many clothes of yours do you want me to wash?
There isn't a lot, why, do you have a large load to wash?
It's really only a small load.
Do you mind washing my clothes?
Not at all. It's no problem.
Have you finished washing clothes?
I've finished my white clothes. I need to wash the rest.
When you do your darks, can you wash some of mine too?
I can do that. Is there a special way you want them washed?
They need to be washed on the gentle cycle.
Do you have a lot of clothes that need to be washed?
There aren't many clothes, is your load big?
My load isn't that big.
If it's a problem, you don't have to do it for me.
I can do this for you. Don't worry.
I greatly appreciate this.
Did you already wash your clothes today?
I've only washed my white clothes.
Could you wash some of my dark clothes with yours?
Is there any special care I should take with your clothes?
The only thing is that they have to be washed on the gentle cycle.
Are there a lot of clothes?
There aren't a lot of clothes, do you have a lot to wash?
It's a medium load.
You don't mind, do you?
No big deal. I'll do it for you.
It's time for bed.
I'm not ready to go to sleep. I'm not tired.
It's quite late, and you have an early day tomorrow.
I'm not going to be able to fall asleep.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
I've tried that before. It really doesn't work.
That's beside the point, you still need to go to bed.
Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep?
If I let you do that, then you're just going to be up all night.
I promise I'll go to sleep soon.
No, you're going to sleep now, so good night.
See you in the morning.
Shouldn't you already be in bed?
I can't sleep. I'm really not all that tired.
You need to get some rest, as you have to get up early in the morning.
It's impossible for me to get to sleep right now.
Just close your eyes, and try not to think.
That really does not work for me.
It doesn't matter, you need to get some sleep.
How about I tire myself out, and then fall asleep when I'm tired?
Then you're not going to go to sleep.
Don't worry, I'll make sure and get to sleep in a little while.
I want you in bed, right now, so sweet dreams.
Fine. Sleep well yourself.
Isn't it past your bedtime already?
I am not sleepy.
It's getting late, and you have to wake up early tomorrow.
There is no way that I can fall asleep right now.
Try listening to some soft music.
It won't work. I'm nowhere close to being tired.
I really don't care, just go to sleep.
What if I stay up and do something, until I get tired?
You'll be up all night if I let you do that.
I'm going to get to sleep eventually.
You need to go to sleep now, so go to sleep.
Good night.
Wake up, it's time for school.
I'm so tired. Let me sleep for five more minutes.
You have to get up and get ready for school.
I know, but just five more minutes.
I can't let you go back to sleep, because you won't wake back up.
I promise I'll wake up, in five minutes.
You still need to eat breakfast, take a shower, and get dressed.
I realize that, and I can do all that when I wake up in five minutes.
I don't want you to be late for school today.
I'm not going to be late today.
Fine, five more minutes.
Get up, it's time for you to get ready.
Let me just get five more minutes of sleep.
I would, but you need to start getting ready for school.
I understand, but all I want is five more minutes of sleep.
If I let you go back to sleep, I know that you won't get up in five minutes.
Trust me. I'm going to wake up.
You have a lot to get done this morning.
I already know, and I'll take care of all that when I wake up.
I want you to be on time for school today.
I'll make it to school on time. Don't worry.
I'll let you sleep for a little while longer.
I really appreciate that.
It's time for you to wake up.
Give me five more minutes. I'm really tired this morning.
I'm sorry, but it's time for you to get ready for school.
I get that, but let me just sleep for a little bit longer.
You're not going to get up in five minutes if I let you fall back asleep.
Believe me. I will get up and get ready in five minutes.
There's a lot that you need to do this morning.
I understand, and it will get done after I wake up in five minutes.
I would like for you to not be late for school.
I'm going to be on time today.
Go back to sleep then, but only five more minutes.

Perhaps you would like to talk to customer service.
That's a start, I guess.
They're right upstairs.
That sounds good. I'll take the escalator.
Good luck. I hope someone can help you.
I'm sorry, but I lost it.
I'm sorry, but store policy requires a receipt.
But I bought it yesterday.

That sounds good. I'll take the elevator right now.
Good luck.
Can I return this radio, please?

Someone must be able to help me.
Someone in customer service might be able to help you.
Yes, if anyone can help me, it's customer service.
Just take the escalator upstairs.
No problem. May I have your receipt, please?
Sorry. I could not find it.
We can't give you a refund without a receipt.
You know, I bought it at 3 p.m. yesterday.
I wish I could help you, but it's store policy.
Every rule has an exception.
Perhaps if you try customer service.
Yes, they might be able to help me.
They're upstairs. Good luck!

It won't play my DVDs.
This is a good product. I wonder what went wrong.
I don't know. I trust this brand. This was a fluke, I think.
You're right, this is a good brand. This new one should work just fine.
Exchanging a DVD
May I exchanged an opened DVD?
Certainly, as long as you have your receipt.
I'm sorry, but you're only allowed to return items within 30 days.
Is there any way I can exchange it?
I am not coming here anymore.
I'm sorry, but please don't blame me.
Pardon me. May I ask you a question?
I opened this DVD. Can I still return it?
No problem. May I have your receipt?
Oh, it looks like you bought this more than 30 days ago.
Can't you bend the rules just a little bit?
You just lost yourself another customer.
Don't get mad at me, please. I don't make the rules.
Can you help me, please?
No problem. What is your question?
Is it possible to return an opened DVD?
Sure, as long as you have your receipt.
I'm sorry. You can't return something you bought more than 30 days ago.
Yes, but this is only day 32. Isn't that okay?
I'm sorry, but rules are rules.
Well, this is ridiculous. I won't shop here anymore.
Well, if I was the boss, the rules might be different.
Can you give me a little help, please?
That's what I'm here for.
Can I return this DVD even though I already opened it?
It's right here in my wallet.
Oh, the date on the receipt says that you bought it too long ago to return it.
But aren't there any exceptions?
If I make an exception for you, I have to do it for everyone.
How do you expect to keep loyal customers?
I wish I could help you, but I didn't make the rules.
Would you help me, please?
I want to return this opened DVD. Is that possible?
No problem at all. Do you have your receipt?
Let me dig it out of my wallet.
I'm sorry. You can't return something more than 30 days old.
There must be some way around this.
I'm sorry, but I have to tell everyone the same thingÃ¢â‚¬â€no.
That's the dumbest rule I ever heard of.
Maybe the rules will change if we lose all our customers.

I'll just check out a few other stores.
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

It was on sale yesterday.
Still, couldn't you sell it to me today at the sale price?

I had my heart set on buying this dress.
Well, feel free to browse. We have other items on sale today.

Misleading Advertisement
I'm glad these batteries are on sale.
I'm sorry. These batteries are not on sale.
But that's what the ad says.
I'm sorry. If you look at the ad again, you'll see that the other brand is on sale.
You're right. I misread the ad.
Yes, many people make that mistake.
You can't blame them. It's a confusing ad.
You're right. Many ads are like that.
As long as I'm here.
Just one second, and I'll get you the batteries that are on sale.
It's about time these batteries went on sale.

Yes, the other brand of batteries is on sale.
I see. I've got the wrong brand.
Yes, it's an easy mistake to make.
The ad is written in a misleading way.
I agree. It seems like all ads are meant to confuse you.
It's not the first or last time.

Going to an Antique Shop
I want to find an old music box.
We have a great selection. What decade are you looking for?
Do you have anything made in the 1920s?
We have six.
Do any of them have dancing figures?
Actually, two of them have dancing figures.
That's fantastic. I think I like this one.
A good choice. I prefer that one myself.
Is there any warranty with this?
Oh, no, I'm afraid not. These things are just too old to guarantee anything.
Even if they break down, they're still works of art.
Excuse me. I'm looking for an old music box.
Any particular decade?
Something made in the 20s would be nice.
We had seven, but we sold one this morning.
Are dancing figures a part of any of the boxes?
You're in luck. Two of them have dancing figures.
These are great. I think I'll take this one.
Yes, that one is very nice.
Does this come with a warranty?
I'm sorry, but you just have to take your chances.
That doesn't surprise me.
Even if it doesn't work, it's a beautiful collectible.
Pardon me. I need an old music box.
Exactly how old a box do you want?
Actually, I was thinking about something from the 1920s.
We still have six left.
Do any of the boxes have dancing figures?
Dancing figures are quite popular. Two of the boxes have them.
I love the dancing figures. I'll take this music box.
Yes, I think you'll be very satisfied with that one.
I was wondering, does this come with any kind of warranty?
No. But if something goes wrong with it, I know someone who repairs these things.
I was just hoping.
It's amazing that these things still work as well as they do.
I want to purchase an old music box.
We have a good variety. What decade would you like?
I was hoping I could find something made in the 20s.
There are six on this table.
I hope at least one of them has dancing figures.
Many people like the dancing figures. Two of our boxes have the figures.
It's so hard to choose. I think I'll take this one.
That one will bring you many hours of pleasure.
Does a warranty come with this music box?
I'm sorry, but if it breaks down, you're on your own.
I just thought I would ask.
When you buy a Model T, you can't expect a warranty.
I'm searching for an old music box.
You came to the right place. Any particular decade?
If you had a box made in the 20s, that would be nice.
We just got one in yesterday, so now we have six.
Would any of them have dancing figures?
Yes, we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures.
They're both so beautiful. Let me have this one, I think.
That one truly is a beautiful piece of work, isn't it?
One last question: Do you provide a warranty with the box?
Oh, no. Everything we sell here is Ã¢â‚¬Ëœas is.'
I guess I was asking for too much.
If it breaks down, maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet.
Buying a Pan
I need a pan.
Okay. Do you have a particular size in mind?
The bigger the better, I think.
Look at this one. It's our biggest pan.
That is big enough, but it's too heavy for me.
Okay, we have the same thing in aluminum.
This is nice and light. But it has an aluminum handle.
Try this one. Same aluminum pan, but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle.
This is very nice. I'll take this one.
That's a good choice. How do you want to pay for it?
Cash. Oh, I almost forgot. I need a lid, too.
I'm so sorry. A lid comes with the pan. Here it is.
I'd like to purchase a pan.
Is there any particular size that you want?
I cook a lot of big meals.
What do you think of this one? It's a 16" pan.
That's the right size, but it's so heavy.
Well, look at our aluminum pan. It's much lighter.
Yes, this is very light, but the handle is also aluminum.
No problem. Look at this one. Same pan, but with a lightweight wooden handle.
Great. This is exactly what I was looking for. I'll buy it.
I think you'll love this pan. Do you want to pay with cash?
Yes. Oh, wait a second, please. What about a lid?
I'm sorry. I forgot to show it to you. Here it is. It comes with the pan.
Can you help me find a pan?
Are you looking for a small, medium, or large pan?
I want a big pan.
Does this one look big enough?
It's the right size, but it weighs too much.
Well, what do you think of the aluminum pan?
It's light enough, but the handle will get too hot after cooking.
Here's the same pan, but it has a space-age, heat-resistant plastic handle.
My family's going to love this one. I'll take it.
I'm so happy that you found what you wanted. Do you want to use a credit card?
Sure. Wait, wait. Does a lid come with this pan?
Oh, I'm sorry. Here's the lid. Yes, it comes with the pan.
I'm looking for a pan I can use in my kitchen.
What size pan were you thinking of?
I've already got a small pan. I need a big one.
Well, this one might work for you.
No, that's way too heavy a pan for me.
Here, lift this aluminum pan. It's the same size.
Yes, it's very lightweight. But I don't want this aluminum handle.
Here's a similar aluminum pan. But it has a heat-resistant handle.
This feels very nice. It's perfect. I'll take it.
I knew we'd find the right pan sooner or later. How would you like to pay?
Cash. But first, I need a lid for this pan.
Oh, no problem. Here's the lid that comes with the pan.

Overdraft fees.
You will be required to pay a small fee for every time you overdraft.

That's it for today. Thank you.
Do you have any questions?
Tell me about fees.
What fees are you referring to?
I want to know about overdraft fees.
We charge a small fee every time you overdraft.

I don't have to pay any fees?
You'll only have to pay the initial fee.
That's fine. I appreciate your help.
I have a serious problem.
Explain it to me.
I never got a bank statement for fees that I owe.
I'm sorry, but I guess we didn't send a statement out.
My fees increased, because I didn't know about my fees.
I see where that is a problem.
Can you fix it?
I will cancel the fees that you owe.
You're canceling all the fees?
You still need to pay the initial fee.
What's your problem?
I owe fees, but a bank statement never came in the mail about it.
I have no idea about the fee, so my fees went up.
I understand your problem.
Will you be able to solve my problem?
I'm going to cancel the fees you owe.
So, I don't have to pay any of it?
The initial fee still must be paid.
That's fabulous. Thank you very much.
What is your problem?
There were charges on my debit card that I never made.
Do you have a statement for your debit card?
I do.

We have chocolate mousse cake, and a spicy rum apple crisp for our specials.
The apple crisp sounds great.
Since there are four of you, would you like to split a second dessert?
Good suggestion. Could you please bring us a chocolate mousse cake and four dessert forks, please?
Would you like coffee or tea with your dessert?
Let's have four coffees, please.
OK. I will be right back with your desserts and drinks.
Thank you! We have really enjoyed our meal here.
So how was your meal?
Our meal was wonderful!
Would you like to finish your evening with us with some dessert?
I am full, but maybe we could split a few desserts.
Tonight's dessert specials include chocolate mousse cake, and a spicy rum apple crisp.
I would love the apple crisp.
That is a good choice, but would you like to split a second dessert for the four of you?
Add in a chocolate mousse cake and we're good. We will also need four dessert forks, please.
Can I bring you some coffee or tea with your dessert?
We would like two coffees and two teas.
I will put your dessert order in and be right back with your drinks.
Thanks, and may we have our check when you come back? We have theater tickets and need to leave soon.
Did your meal meet with your approval?
Our meal was absolutely perfect!
How about a dessert to top off that wonderful meal?
Dessert sounds perfect, but I would like to split something with my friends.
On this evening's dessert list, we have chocolate mousse cake, and a spicy rum apple crisp.
I think that the apple crisp would be wonderful.
One dessert will serve two, so would you like to split a second one?
We would also like a piece of chocolate mousse cake. Could you bring us four dessert forks, please?
How about some coffee and tea with your dessert?
We are all tea drinkers. Please bring us four teas.
I will prepare your desserts and have someone bring you your drinks right away.
The hot drinks first would be great. Thanks!
A Mistake by the Waitress
Here is your breakfast!
Thanks so much. Miss, I believe I ordered my eggs scrambled, and these are fried.
Sorry, your friend over there ordered fried eggs, and I gave you his by mistake.
Oh yeah. Here, I will just trade with him.
Here are your pancakes, sir.
But I ordered waffles!
I am so sorry!
That's OK. I will eat my eggs and bacon, and you can take my pancakes back.
Good, sir. I will take care of that right away.
I believe you ordered the Grand Slam breakfast.
Oh, good! You know, I am looking at my plate and I ordered scrambled eggs, not fried.
I just noticed that I accidentally brought you your friend's breakfast.
I can just trade with him, thank you.
And pancakes for you, sir.
I am sorry, but I think I ordered waffles.
I am sorry that I misheard you.
Just please take my pancakes to trade for waffles. While I am waiting, I will eat my bacon and eggs.
I will get straight back to you with your waffles.
One Grand Slam breakfast for you!
Thanks. You know, I just noticed that these eggs are fried, and I ordered scrambled.
Thank you for pointing that out. I mistakenly gave you your friend's breakfast.
Not a problem. I can just trade my plate with his.
A special order of banana pancakes for you!
Pancakes? I don't like pancakes. I ordered waffles.
I am so sorry, sir!
I can eat my bacon and eggs while you are exchanging my pancakes for waffles.
I will go trade those pancakes for waffles right now.
That would take care of it, thank you.
This is a great meal!
Thank you. I am glad that everything turned out so well.
Who taught you how to cook this well?
I took a cooking class at the Culinary Institute.
Wow, what is in this chicken dish?
Isn't that great? That is coconut ginger chicken with rice.
Is the soup a shrimp soup?
Yes, there is shrimp in there along with sea vegetables and lemon grass.
I think I got lucky in choosing a wine that blends with this meal.
I appreciate you bringing the wine. It goes well with the chicken.
I really love this meal.
Thanks. I was hoping that you would all enjoy this meal.
Where did you learn to cook these amazing dishes?
I got a really wonderful cookbook for my birthday and decided to try out a few of the recipes.
The chicken is out of this world!
I love that dish as well. It is coconut chicken with rice.
I was wondering if there was shrimp in the soup.
Yes, that soup has a shrimp base. I also added sea vegetables and lemon grass.
It worked out well that the wine that I brought to share seems to blend well with this meal.
I love this wine! It goes very well with the chicken.
George, how is your chicken?
My chicken tastes all right, but it is pretty dry. How is your fish?
My fish is pretty dry too.
It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long. It doesn't seem fresh.
Yes, it seems that way to me also.
How are your vegetables?
My vegetables are very soggy.
Mine are the same way. It seems like they've been overcooked.
I don't usually complain, but I think that we should mention this to the waiter.
I agree. Maybe they can bring us some better food.
George, is your chicken OK?
It tastes great, but it is really dry. Is your fish all right?
My fish is very dry.
I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it.
That's exactly what I was thinking had happened.
Are your vegetables OK?
The vegetables are kind of mushy.
So are mine. I think they left them cooking too long.
The food here is usually good, so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is a problem.
I think that you are right. Maybe they can give us a free dessert or something.
Does your chicken taste all right?
The chicken tastes wonderful, but it is kind of dry. Is your fish OK?
My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry.
It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us.
Yes, maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight.
Are your vegetables a little mushy?
The vegetables seem to not be very fresh.
Mine aren't so good, either.
I usually enjoy the meals here, so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is something wrong with this meal.
I think that we should let someone know. They will probably want to fix the problem.
Do you want some dessert?
No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?
Here comes our waitress with our check.
The service here has been really great, don't you think?
Yes, the service was quite good.
So, let's look at the check. The total is $36.00.
How much do you think we should leave for a tip?
Usually people leave 15 percent, but this was exceptional service. I am thinking that maybe 20 percent would be appropriate.
I agree that 20 percent would be just about right.
OK, so that will bring her tip to $7.20. Add it to the $36.00 and the total is $43.20.
Yes, what a nice dinner that was!
We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon.
Would you like some more coffee?
No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill.
The waitress is bringing the bill right now.
This waitress has really been on top of things, hasn't she?
Yes, this waitress did a great job.
OK, let's see what the damage is. The total for our meal is $36.00.
What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip?
Fifteen percent is a normal tip, but she really did a great job. What do you think about 20 percent this time?
Yes, 20 percent would be perfect.
Her tip will end up being $7.20 plus the bill of $36.00. The total will be $43.20.
Yes, that was one fantastic meal!
I agree. Maybe we can come back again next week.
No, I'm good. All we need now is our check.
The waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak.
I have never had bad service at this restaurant, but this time was really exceptional.
Yes, she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining experience.
Let's take a look at our bill. The total price for our dinner is $36.00.
How much money should we leave for a tip?
I know that 15 percent is a normal tip, but I really thought that this waitress went out of her way for us. What do you think about tippingher 20 percent?
She definitely deserves 20 percent for a tip.
So we can add her tip of $7.20 to the bill of $36.00 and the total will be $43.20.
Yes, what a wonderful meal!
It absolutely was a great meal. We'll have to return here for lunch sometime.
Where is our waitress anyway?
Yes, the service hasn't been the best. Is that our waitress over there?
I'll walk over and get the bill, since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon.
Good idea. Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together.
So the bill is $36.00.
My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip.
I agree, but we don't really know the whole story. There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control.
Let's leave 10%, so that we at least leave something for the service.
I agree. We will leave $3.60 for the tip.
Good luck finding the waitress!
The service this evening has kind of sucked. Is that our server over there?
I'll go get the check, since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way.
Good. I'll just stay here until you get back.
So the total is $36.00 for our dinner.
How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves?
I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service.
I kind of feel the same way, but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight.
I think that we should leave 10%.
$3.60 will be the right amount for the tip.
Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight, hasn't she?
I think that is our waitress over by the bar. Boy, the service has not been good this evening.
She doesn't appear to be headed this way, so I will go get the check.
Good. Just bring it back and we'll total it together.
Our total for dinner is $36.00.
What do you think would be the right amount to tip?
I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received.
I agree that it was bad service, but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job.
I believe that 10% is just about right.
I think that a tip of $3.60 will be the right amount to leave.

The service did not help the situation.
Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to?

I would like to get a double cheeseburger.
Would you like everything on it?
I would like everything on it, thank you.
Do you want any fries?
Let me get some large curly fries.
Can I get you anything to drink?

Your total comes to $5.48.
Here you go. Thank you very much.
Asking a Friend About Car Insurance
What kind of car insurance do you have?
I went with the Automobile Club.
Why did you choose that company?
I looked at the price of the type of insurance that I wanted.
What should I think about in choosing services?
There are websites that will figure out what coverage is right for you.
What did you end up buying?
Well, my car is very old, so I didn't worry so much about what it would cost to repair it. I did buy a lot of coverage for fixing someone else's car.
Have you ever had to use your insurance?
I never had to use my insurance.
When you insured your car, what kind did you buy?
I decided to buy from GEICO.
What influenced your choice of companies?
I looked at the customer satisfaction rating of the company.
How did you figure out what services to buy?
Every individual has different considerations. Your agent can help you understand what you need to think about.
What did you place an emphasis on when you bought your insurance?
I carry a lot of liability insurance because I own a house and need to protect it from a lawsuit.
Did you ever get into an accident and need your insurance?
I was in an accident and was happy that I had good insurance to cover it.
What car insurance company did you decide to go with when you bought your new car?
State Farm seemed like the best deal for me.
How did you make that decision?
I compared rates and services available.
Where can I get help in figuring out what I need to purchase for coverage?
You can pick up a pamphlet at your insurance company that will explain the options to you.
What did you decide to cover yourself for?
I pretty much carry the average amount in all categories as the agent recommended.
How many times have you actually used your insurance?
I was in an accident, but it was the other person's fault and their insurance covered it.
I am interested in buying auto insurance.
Sure, I can help you. Did you bring all of your registration papers?
Yes, I brought everything with me.
Is your car with you?
Yes, it is out in the parking lot.
Wonderful. Let's go out and check to see what shape it is in.
OK, can you help me figure out what I should insure my car for?
I will look it up on the Blue Book list and we will factor in its condition.
What else do I need to consider?
Yes, you need to figure in liability for damage to the other car as well as injury issues as well.
Good morning, I need to buy car insurance for the used car I just bought.
Yes, no problem. Do you have your registration and Certificate of Ownership with you?
Yes, it is all right here.
Did you drive your car here?
Yes, it is out in the back.
That's great. We'll go out and check the condition of your car.
I understand, what should I insure my car for?
There is a Blue Book price for your car and we will use that price.
What other things do I need to insure for?
We will factor in damage to the other car as well as property damage and injury.
I just bought a used car and need to insure it.
We can take care of that right now. Do you have all of your paperwork with you?
Yes, I took care of all of that and have the papers with me.
Did you bring your car with you?
Yes, it is parked on the street.
Fine, I need to go out with you to check your car for wear and tear.
Fine, how will I know how much I should insure my car for?
After looking at your car, I will use the Blue Book price and we will consider the condition of the car.
Are there other considerations when I insure my car?
We always need to think about property damage, damage to other vehicles, and injury.
Deciding to Buy the Car
I really like that car and I am thinking of buying it.
Yes, I agree. Do you want to take it to a mechanic to have it checked out?
I already took care of that yesterday.
That's good. Have you discussed the price with the seller?
Yes, I think we've agreed upon a fair price.
Have you set up your financing to pay for this car?
Yes, my parents are going to loan me the money.
That's good. Would you like me to go talk to the seller with you and drive your car home?
That would be a great help!
Glad to be of help. I can't wait to see your new car!
I think that that car drove really well and is a good deal.
It seems to be a good choice for you. You might want to have a mechanic take a look at it just to be sure.
My friend is a mechanic and he came and looked at it for me this morning.
That was smart of you to think ahead. Have you and the seller agreed upon a price?
Yes, he is willing to accept the price that I offered him.
Have you thought about how to pay for your car?
I saved up enough money to pay cash for this car.
You've really thought this through. Let me go with you to make the payment and drive your car home for you.
That would make it a lot easier for me.
Let's go take care of that right now. I really want to see your new car!
Thank you for letting me test drive the car.
So do you think that you would like to purchase this car?
You know, I am not interested in purchasing the car right now.
What's the problem? We can at least sit down and maybe work out a deal.
Actually, I have several other cars to look at before I make my decision.
What didn't you like about the car? Maybe I can fix something for you.
It is a combination of things, but I appreciate your time.
I have some other cars you might want to look at.
Again, I appreciate your time but I will not be purchasing this car.
Give me a call if you change your mind. Have a good day.
I appreciate you letting me take the car out for a spin.
Why don't you come over here and we can work out the details of the purchase?
I don't think that this is the car for me at this point in time.
It's a great deal. Let's talk price. Maybe you'll change your mind.
This is only the first car that I've looked at.
Is there something in particular that didn't look good to you?
It isn't one thing in particular, but I think I can do better for my money.
I really think that you should reconsider.
Thank you again for your time.
B: Thank you for stopping by. Good luck in your search for a car.
I enjoyed taking the car out for a test drive.
Isn't that a great car? Let's work out the details of purchase.
I will not be purchasing the car today.
Why don't you take a second look at that car? You'll see that it is as good a deal as you are going to get.
I need to compare this car to others to make an informed choice.
You said on the phone that this is the kind of car you wanted. What has changed your mind?
I just really need to make sure that I get the best car for my money.
You know, you can look around but I just don't think that you are going to get a better deal for your money.
I will continue looking around for cars and will get back to you if I change my mind.
OK, then. Have a good day.
I was thinking about buying this used car, and was wondering if you would take a look at it for me to see if it has any problems.
Sure, pull up over there and we'll take a look.
I just wasn't sure what to look for.
The first thing you do is look for any signs of wear both inside and out. We will also look at the body for signs of major repair.
Someone told me that I could go online and see if the car is listed as having been in a major accident.
Yes, that's right. Next, we will turn on the engine and I will check under the hood to look at the hoses and belts.
Should we take the car for a drive?
Yes, but before we pull away, let's check to make sure that the radio, turn signals, lights, and seats all work properly.
As I am driving what should I be checking?
You want to make sure that the brakes don't pull to one side and that the car has good alignment and acceleration.
You are welcome. Enjoy driving your car!
Could you take a few minutes and see if there are any problems with this used car that I am thinking of buying?
I am happy to help. Just pull up and we'll give it a good look.
I don't know much about cars.
We need to look inside and outside for signs of an accident or major damage. Also, we need to look for wear on the tires.
If I go online I can also check to see if the car has been involved in a major accident.
Yes, you can check the history of the car online. Next, we need to turn on the engine and take a look at the belts and hoses.
Will you take a drive with me to check handling?
A test drive would be good. But first let's make sure that the turn signals, radio, lights, and seats work properly.
On a test drive, what should I look for?
We are checking for solid braking and good overall handling.
I appreciate you helping me figure out what to look for.
My pleasure. This seems to be a solid car and a good choice for you.
I want to buy this used car, but I need help figuring out if there are any problems with it.
I can help you with that. Drive the car over by the garage and we'll check it out.
I know some things to look for, but I know there are other special things to look for.
Always start with looking for signs of major damage that may have been repaired and also check tire wear.
If the car has been in a major accident, that should have been recorded online.
Right. All major accidents should have been recorded. Next start the car up, pop the hood, and we'll take a look at the belts and hoses.
I would like for you to take a test drive with me.
We'll do that in a minute, but first we should check that the radio, turn signals, and all of the lights work properly.
As we drive, what am I checking for?
You want to make sure that the alignment is good, that the engine accelerates smoothly, and that the car can safely brake to a stop.
I like knowing what to look for when buying a used car and appreciate the help.
This car is in good shape and should give you no major problems. Enjoy it!
I am buying a used car and don't know much about financing it.
I can help you. Do you have a down payment?
Yes, I have saved up three thousand dollars for a down payment.
Good, because you will not be able to get a loan without putting some money down on the car.
I don't know where exactly to get a loan.
Other than friends or family, you can go to a bank, credit union, or use the dealer financing if you bought the car off a car lot.
What is the best choice for financing?
It depends. The worst financing deal is usually at the dealer, but they will oftentimes give you a loan when a bank turns you down.
What do I need to have with me when I apply for the loan?
You will need a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip for the car. Before the loan is complete, you will need to show proof of insurance. Good luck!
Can you help me learn about financing options for a used car?
I would love to help you with what I know. I am assuming that you have a down payment.
Yes, I already borrowed some money from my parents for the down payment.
That will work. A bank or finance company will not loan you money without a down payment.
I am not sure who will loan money to me.
You can apply for a loan at a bank, credit union, or approach the used car dealer who sold you the car. You might also try family and friends.
Who offers the best interest rate?
A credit union will usually give you the best interest rate, but the dealer will almost always give you some type of loan.
Do I need any documents when I apply for a car loan?
Be sure that you take a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip. You will have a few days to produce proof of insurance. Enjoy your new car!
I need help figuring out how to pay for a used car that I am thinking of buying.
I would be happy to help you. Have you saved up a down payment?
I will be getting money from selling my old car.
You really need that money so that a bank or finance company will loan you the rest of the money that you need.
Who gives loans out to people wanting to buy cars?
Usually people go to a bank, credit union, or, if they bought the car at a car lot, they might use the dealer finance company.
What is the best place to get financing?
The dealer will charge you a higher interest rate, but sometimes they are your only choice if you are just starting out.
Will I need some documentation when I apply for the loan?
Just make sure that you bring them your last pay stub and a copy of the pink slip. You can then work on getting insured. Enjoy your new car!
Making an Appointment with the DMV
I need to go to the DMV and don't know how to make an appointment with them.
First of all you need to figure out if you really need to be there in person. Sometimes you can take care of your business at the Automobile Club or at the DMV website.
If I do need to go in, how can I make an appointment?
You can either make an appointment by going online or by calling the phone number listed on their website.
What if I just show up there?
If you have all day to wait and a good book to read, that might work for you.
Is the DMV open on Saturdays?
Due to state budget cuts, the DMV is no longer open on Saturdays.
I think that you have just convinced me to join the Automobile Club!
Yes, the Automobile Club takes all the pain out of DMV transactions!
How can I make an appointment at the DMV?
You could check the DMV website or see if the Automobile Club could help you. Many things can be taken care of without actually going in to the DMV in person.
How do I make an appointment if I have to actually go in?
You have two choices. You can call them at the number listed on their website or you can contact them online.
Can I just walk in and get help?
Without an appointment, you will be waiting for many hours. I would not advise it.
Can I take care of this on a Saturday?
Unfortunately, the DMV is no longer open on Saturdays.
It probably would be easier for me to join the Automobile Club.
The Automobile Club has many benefits, and taking care of your DMV transactions is one of the best benefits.
Can you help me figure out how to make an appointment with the DMV?
I would try to avoid going in to the DMV in person. If you are a member of the Automobile Club, they oftentimes can take care of things for you or you can try the DMV website.
It would be nice not to have to go in but if I have to, how do I make an appointment?
The easiest way to contact them is online, but they also have a phone number listed on the website if you prefer to call them on the phone.
What do they do if you just show up with no appointment?
That is not a good way to go. You could be left waiting for many hours and there is no guarantee that they will see you at all!
What about going to the DMV on Saturday?
For a while the DMV was open on Saturday, but not anymore.
I think that the Automobile Club idea was a good suggestion.
You should check out the Automobile Club. I think you would enjoy being a member.
NEGOTIATING A PRICE WITH A STUDENT
This car is exactly what I want!
I am glad that you like it. I've had good experiences with this car.
So, how much do you want for the car?
Well, the price in the paper was five thousand dollars.
Yes, I know, but I think that might be a little high for this car.
I might be able to come down a little on the price.
How about selling the car for four thousand?
No, that's way less than I could accept. However, I could accept forty-five hundred.
That sounds fair to me.
It's a deal then. Thank you!
I really love this car!
Great! I was hoping that it would go to a driver who appreciates it.
How much are you willing to take for the car?
As I am sure you noticed, the price on the window is five thousand dollars.
Don't you think you could come down a bit on the price?
You seem like a nice person. Maybe I could lower the price a bit.
Would you sell it to me for four thousand?
I am thinking more in the line of four thousand five hundred.
I'll take it then!
Perfect! That works for both of us.
I am definitely interested in buying this car.
Wonderful! It's good to find a person who really needs this car.
What is the price for this car?
The price I listed on eBay was five thousand dollars.
I was thinking that maybe you might be willing to lower the price a bit.
You know I just got a good deal on my new car. I think I can afford to knock a little off of this car.
I was thinking that four thousand would be a good price.
I couldn't go that low, but I could sell it for forty-five hundred.
That would work well for me.
It's done then. I've enjoyed doing business with you.
How much does this car cost?
Well, come on in and we'll sit down and discuss that right now. How much do you want to pay?
I really was just wondering what the price is.
Well, figuring in tax, license, dealer prep, and registration, I can let this car go for fifteen thousand dollars.
I was thinking a little lower than that.
Whoa! Let's keep talking here. I am sure we can work something out. What price are you thinking is fair?
I was thinking more like thirteen thousand dollars.
You know, you look like you are a sweet kid. I'll give it to you for fourteen thousand dollars.
That would be a good price if the car was in great shape, but it is registered as having been in an accident.
OK, thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty, and that's my final offer.
If I want to buy this car, what will it cost me?
Let me get my contract out, and we'll figure that out for you right now.
Can't you just tell me what it costs?
You know, I am prepared to offer you a great deal today on that car. With tax, license, registration, and dealer prep, the total will be fifteen thousand dollars.
Fine, I'll come back later with my father, who is a lawyer, and we can talk then.
I am sure that we can work something out. What price were you thinking would be a good deal for you?
Thirteen thousand would be more like it.
Fourteen thousand for this car is a good price. For that I am practically giving it away.
Normally that would be a good price, but that car has been in an accident.
Yes, I see your point. Thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty is my final offer.
How much money for this car?
Yes, that car is beautiful, isn't it? Come on inside and we'll discuss the price.
I just want to know the price.
Fifteen thousand out the door! What a deal! That will, of course, include tax, license, registration, and dealer prep.
I appreciate your help, and I'll see you later.
Oh, you look like a smart person. What price would be fair to you?
I think that thirteen thousand would be fair for this car.
I can see that you are a smart buyer. Fourteen thousand is my best price.
If the car hadn't been in an accident, that would be a good price, but it has a few minor problems.
Thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty is my final offer.
I really love the look of this car.
Would you like to test drive this car?
Yes, I would love to take it for a drive.
I'll go get the keys, and you can get out your Driver's License and Proof of Insurance.
Here's my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance.
Well, just sign this card, and we'll be on our way. Don't forget to buckle your seatbelt!
Can I take it on the freeway to check for acceleration?
That would be fine; just don't exceed the speed limit!
This car handles great, and I love it!
I am glad that you like this car.
The styling of this car really appeals to me.
Would you like to take this car for a spin?
That would be a great idea.
Fine, all I'll need from you is your Driver's License and Proof of Insurance.
I've got my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance ready.
OK, after you sign this card, we'll take a spin. Make sure you buckle your seatbelt!
I would like to go on the freeway to test it for speed.
As long as you don't exceed the speed limit, that would be fine.
Whoa, this car has wonderful pickup!
Yes, this is a very popular car.
Wow, what a cool car!
How about taking this car out for a drive to see if you like how it handles?
I would enjoy seeing how it handles.
While I'm getting the keys, you just need to take out your Driver's License and Proof of Insurance.
I found my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance.
Great! Sign this card, buckle your seatbelt, and we'll hit the road.
I want to take the car up to freeway speed.
Take a left at the next signal to enter the freeway. Just keep it under the speed limit!
This car has a nice smooth ride, even on the freeway.
You know, I've driven it myself, and I agree with you.
Now I've decided to buy this car, how do I transfer the title to myself?
Actually, your best bet is to contact the Automobile Club or to go to the DMV website.
Basically, what will I need to do?
Both buyer and seller need to transfer the ownership by filling out a Change of Ownership form and signing over the Certificate of Title, which will be either pink or rainbow.
Will I have to pay any fees?
All of the transfer fees are the responsibility of the buyer.
How much will it cost to transfer the title?
The DMV has a special formula that they use to calculate the fees. They will figure it out for you.
Do I need a Smog Certificate?
No, only if your car was manufactured before 1975.
Where do I take my forms?
You can take them to the DMV. You have ten days to complete the process.
I don't really know all that much about the paperwork involved in buying a used car.
If you are a member of the Automobile Club, they can help guide you through the process, or just go to the DMV website.
What is the big picture of what I will need to take care of?
The car has a pink or rainbow Certificate of Title, which both the buyer and seller need to sign. They also both need to fill out theChange of Ownership form.
Who pays the fees to transfer the ownership?
The buyer must pay all of the fees.
Will it be really expensive to transfer the title?
The DMV will calculate the fees for you when you submit the paperwork.
What about a Smog Certificate?
No, your car was built after 1974, so you will be fine.
Where can I turn in my forms?
If you are a member of the Automobile Club, you can turn in your forms to them.
Can you help me figure out how to transfer the title of the car I wish to buy so it will be registered in my name?
You can go to the DMV website for information or, if you are a member of the Automobile Calub, they can be very helpful.
Can you just fill me in on what needs to be done?
When you both fill out and sign a Change of Ownership form and sign the Certificate of Title, the ownership will be transferred.
Are there any fees involved?
As the buyer, you are responsible for all of the fees.
How much money will I have to pay to transfer the title?
The only way to calculate the fee is to turn your paperwork in to the DMV, and they will figure it out for you.
Do I need to take the car in for a Smog Certificate?
No, your car is a newer model, so you won't need one.
Whom do I give my forms to when they are completed?
Check online for special situations, but usually you can mail your forms in to the DMV.
Where is the best place to buy a used car?
I have always purchased my used cars from an advertisement in the paper, but actually you have many options.
Where else could I look for a car?
You could look on the Internet. Craigslist is best, as most of the cars listed there are sold locally.
What would be best if I wanted to actually go see a lot of used cars that are for sale?
The best place is CarMax, which is a very large used car lot.
Where is CarMax?
There are many of them. You can look on the Internet or in the phone book for the one closest to you.
How about the listings on the college bulletin board?
Actually, that is not a bad way to go, especially near the end of a semester as students are moving away.
Can you help me figure out the best place to buy a used car?
There are a lot of different ways to go. I bought my last one from an advertisement in the paper.
What are my other options for looking for a used car?
Internet listings are good. Craigslist is pretty good because most of the cars are sold locally.
I think that I might actually like to see many used cars together so I can compare them.
The biggest used car lot is CarMax. I would check that place out.
How can I find out where CarMax is?
Look in the phone book or on the Internet for the one closest to you. There are a lot of them.
Have you ever seen the listings on the school bulletin board?
The school bulletin board can have some great deals, as many students sell their cars before they return home or as they get better paying jobs.
Where did you buy your last used car?
I found my last one in an advertisement in the newspaper, but there are a lot of other places to look for used cars.
Besides an advertisement, what else could I do to find a used car?
My friend bought his used car off of Craigslist. It works out better than eBay because the cars listed are located close by.
Is there anywhere I can go to see many used cars all in the same place?
Go to CarMax if you want to see the largest selection of used cars in one place.
I don't know where CarMax is.
CarMax has many car lots in many cities. For the one closest to you, check out the Internet or phone book.
Have you ever known anyone who bought a car off a listing on the university bulletin board?
B: You can get a good deal there. Especially at the end of the year, when students are selling things and returning home.
At the Window of the DMV
Could you tell me what window I should go to?
Do you have an appointment?
Yes, I have an appointment.
The DMV windows are set up for different tasks. What are you here to do?
I need to transfer ownership of a used car.
I can see that you have all of your forms filled out. Drop the forms in that box, and I will call you when your name comes up.
You are welcome. May I see your current Driver's License?
Here is my license, it is not a very good picture of me!
That's a pretty good picture. Just pay the fee over at the last window and you're done!
This is my first time at the DMV, and I don't know what window to go to.
It depends on what you are doing. Did you make an appointment?
I made an appointment last month.
All of the windows are for specific services. What do you need to do today?
I just bought a used car and need to transfer the ownership.
If you just put all of your filled-out forms in the drop box, your name will be called when it comes up.
Thank you, that helps me know what to do.
My pleasure. The only other thing I need is your current Driver's License.
Here is my license, it is a very old picture of me!
You look good in that picture. Take this over to the last window to pay your fee, and you've finished registering your car.
Could you help direct me to the proper window?
There are different windows for different things. Did you make an appointment on the Internet?
I made my appointment over the Internet.
Different windows will be able to help you with different problems. What do you need help with?
I need help transferring the ownership of a new car from my friend to myself.
The signed forms go in the box, and I will call your name in a few minutes.
Thank you for making it seem less confusing.
If you would give me your current Driver's License, I will be able to complete the transfer process.
Here is my license, I never really liked that picture!
That is a great picture! Take the forms over to the last window to pay your fees and you're finished!

I need to use a pen.
Thank you. Now turn in your application at Window B.
Have you taken the written test yet?
You should study before you take it.
I have been studying.
Why don't you take the test?
Do you know if it costs any money to take it?
Since you already paid for your permit, you don't have to pay again.
All right. Do you know if the test covers the whole book?
No, the test skips a lot of things in the book.
Did you pass it the first time that you took it?
No, I didn't, because it was pretty hard.
Well, I hope that I do well.
Did you take the written test?
I haven't taken it yet.
Make sure to study first.
I study every night.
I'm sure you're ready.
Does it cost money?
No, it doesn't cost anything.
Does the test cover everything in the manual?
It skips around.
Did you pass the test your first try?
I thought it would be easy, but I didn't pass it.
Wish me luck.
Have you already taken the written test?
You really need to study for it.
I already know. I have been studying.
You should probably go and take it then.
I'm not sure, but does it cost anything to take it?
No, because you applied for your permit and you paid already.
Will the test be on everything in the manual?
It doesn't cover everything.
When you took the test, did you pass it the first time?
No, I didn't pass it.
Hopefully, I won't fail the test.

You'll be able to take the test again in a couple weeks.

You had pretty bad scores.

You did great on your test.
Did I pass my test?

So, I passed?

About my driving test, did I do well?
You did a fabulous job.
Are you telling me that I passed the test?
That's what I'm telling you.
What did I mess up on?
You did mess up a little on one thing.

You had a little trouble on your parallel parking.

Asking Where to Park on Campus
I need to find somewhere to park.
Off campus or on campus?
I need to find a space on campus.
Why don't you park in the parking structure for students?
Where is the parking structure at?
It's on the west side of the campus.
Do you know if the parking structure is full or not?
It was empty last time I went up there.
How long ago was that?
I went up there early this morning.
Do you think it'll be full now?
It might be. You'll have to go see for yourself.
Do you know where I can park?
Do you need a spot here or off campus?
I want a space on campus.
There's a parking structure for students.
Where can I find it?
Go to the western side of the campus, and you'll find it there.
When I went up there, it wasn't full at all.
When was that?
Sometime this morning.
Would it be full now?
I am really not sure.
I really need to find a parking spot.
Are you looking for a space on or off campus?
Do you know any spaces on campus?
You can park in the student parking structure.
Where is it located?
You'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus.
Do you have any idea if the parking structure has any spaces left?
Last time I checked, it was pretty empty.
What time was it when you went up there?
That was earlier this morning.
It wouldn't be full right now, would it?
Have you ever gotten a parking ticket?
I've never gotten one. Have you?
Really? What did you get one for?
I parked in the red zone.
I needed to get something real quickly.
Where did you park at?
At my apartment building.
Don't you have your own parking spot?
I needed to be fast.
That was very lazy of you.
Have you gotten a parking ticket before?
No, I haven't. What about you?
I got a ticket a couple of days ago.
I got it for parking in the red zone.
Why would you park in the red zone?
I had to run in and get something quickly.
Where were you at?
I got the ticket in front of my apartment.
I thought that you had your own parking spot?
I had to make it quick.
Hope it was worth it.
Did you ever get a parking ticket?
No, have you?
Yes, I just got one the other day.
How'd you get a ticket?
The ticket was for parking in the red zone.
I don't understand why you would do that.
There was nowhere to park, and I needed to run in and get something.
Where'd you get the ticket at?
I parked in front of my apartment building.
What about your parking spot?
But I really needed to be quick.
I bet that you wish you hadn't done that.
Paying Off Parking Tickets
I've gotten a few.
How many is a few?
I've gotten about six.
Have you paid all your tickets off?
Yes, I've paid all of them off.
It's like $130 each ticket.
That's not cheap at all.
I got a parking ticket the other day.
Pay it off, and they'll clear your record.
I'm going to do that as soon as possible.
Only a few.
What's a few?
I've gotten six, I think.
Did you pay your fines?
Of course I have.
How much are the parking tickets?
I think they're $130.
I just got a parking ticket.
You should probably pay the fine soon.
I'm going to pay it today.
How many parking tickets have you gotten before?
I've gotten a few parking tickets before.
How many?
Only about five or six.
Have you paid off your parking tickets?
Yes, I paid my fines.
How much do you have to pay for the ticket?
If I remember correctly, it's about $130.
I got one the other day.
You better make sure you pay it off.
I may just go to the DMV today, so I can pay the fine.
Is there a problem, officer?
Did you not notice that stop sign that you ran through?
I'm sorry, I didn't even notice it.
You didn't see it?
I honestly couldn't see it because of the bushes growing over it.
That's true. Those bushes are a problem.
I swear that I didn't mean to run it.
I can understand why you didn't stop for it.
Are you going to give me a ticket today, sir?
Under the circumstances, I think I'm just going to let you go with a warning.
No problem. Next time, just pay closer attention.
There was a stop sign back there that you didn't stop for.
I really didn't see it.
How'd you miss it?
I only saw bushes at the intersection.
Those bushes are covering the stop sign.
I really didn't mean to run it.
I see why you didn't stop.
Are you still going to write me a ticket?
No, I'm just going to let you go.
Thanks for being so understanding.
That's all right. Make sure to look closely next time.
Driving Through a Red Light
I stopped you for driving through a red light.
Did I really?
You didn't know?
I had no idea that I ran it.
Don't you know that yellow means slow down?
Yes, sir.
Why'd you speed up instead?
I really have no excuse, sir.
I'll have to write you a ticket.
I understand, and I am very sorry.
Here's your ticket.
What's wrong, officer?
You do realize that you ran a red light, don't you?
I did?
You didn't see the red light?
I'm sorry for running it, but I really didn't know.
Didn't you learn that red means stop?
Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light.
I'm giving you a ticket for this.
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.
Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light.
Why'd you pull me over?
Are you aware that you drove through a red light?
I ran a red light?
Yes, you did.
I apologize, but I didn't realize that I did that.
Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down, not speed up?
I did learn that.
So, then why did you speed up?
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm going to have to write you a ticket.
Here you go. Don't do that again.
You're here today to argue your ticket?
I am.
Plead your case.
The police officer that pulled me over said I was speeding.
Were you speeding when you got pulled over?
I was not speeding.
How fast were you going?
In a 40 mph zone, I was only going about 35.
Seeing as the officer that pulled you over isn't here, I'll let you go.
Do I still need to pay the fine?
No, you don't.
I appreciate your understanding.
You want to argue your ticket today?
Yes. That is why I'm here.
Tell me your argument.
I was pulled over for allegedly speeding.
Are you sure you weren't speeding?
To be honest, I really wasn't.
What speed were you going?
I was under the speed limit. I was going 35, when the speed limit was 40.
I'm just going to let you go, since the arresting officer isn't here.
What about my ticket? Do I still need to pay?
I'm so glad for your help.
Are you here about your ticket?
Yes, I am, Your Honor.
What is your argument?
Your Honor, the police officer pulled me over for speeding.
You must've been speeding.
No, Your Honor, I was not.
Tell me how many miles per hour you were going.
I was going 35 in a 40 mph zone.
That's fine, so I'll let you go with a warning.
So, I don't have to pay the ticket?
You won't have to pay the fine.
Thank you very much, Your Honor.
What are you here for today?
I need to fight this ticket that I got.
Is the arresting officer here?
Yes, he is, Your Honor.
I was told by the officer that I ran a red light. That information isn't true.
Why would the officer lie?
I'm not sure, but the signal had a camera on it.
Did the camera take a picture of your license plate?
No, my picture wasn't taken.
There was no picture taken, so I'll let you go.
I would like to fight my ticket.
Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today?
Yes, the officer is here today.
What's your case?
I was pulled over for running a red light, but I never did.
Do you believe that the officer lied?
There was a camera on the signal. So, he was obviously lying.
Your license plate was caught on camera?
A picture of my license plate was never taken.
Since there is no picture of your license plate on record, I'm going to let you go.
Thank you. I'm glad that you believe me.
I need to pay the fine on my ticket.
Do you have the ticket with you?
Yes, I have my ticket with me.
Let me see your ID.
I forgot to bring that with me.
You need it to pay your fine.
Why can't I just give you the money for the fine?
Because, I need to see a photo ID in order to verify who you are.
I think I understand.
All right, come back and bring your ID.
So once I pay this off, my record will be cleared?
Once you pay it, your record will be cleared.
Could I pay for my parking ticket?
I need to see your ticket. Do you have it?
Here's my ticket right here.
I'm going to need to see your ID.
I don't have it.
You can't pay your fine without your ID.
I don't understand why I can't just pay you.
We have to make sure that the person issued the ticket is the one paying it.
Just come back when you have your ID with you.
Will my record be cleared after I pay the fine?
Only if you pay your fine.
I have a parking ticket to pay for.
Did you bring your ticket?
Yes, I remembered to bring my ticket with me today.
Did you bring your ID?
I didn't bring my ID.
You're going to need your ID to pay the ticket.
What do you need my ID for?
We have to know that this ticket is really yours.

Talking to the Traffic School Instructor
I need to take the driver's course. How many hours do I need?
It depends on what you're trying to do with the completion of the course.
I need to get my license.
You're going to need to complete six hours.
How many hours a day can I do?
You can do two hours a day for three days.
That's all I need to do to finish?
Yes, that's all you need to do.
Thanks. I'll get back to you.
May I ask you something?
How many hours behind the wheel do I need?
What do you need to take it for?
I'm trying to get my license.
You need six hours.
Can I do all six hours in one day?
You have to do it in three days.
That's all I have to do?
Well, that's a relief.
I needed to ask you a question.
How many hours of the behind-the-wheel course do I need to take?
Why do you need to take the course?
I want to get my license.
You have to do six hours behind the wheel.
How many days do I need to finish the course?
You can't finish in less than three days.
That sounds easy enough.
Hey man, you hit my car.
I really didn't mean to.
It doesn't matter, because you damaged my car.
It looks okay to me.
Look what you did to my rear bumper.
My bumper is smashed in.
I didn't do that.
Your front bumper is just as damaged.
If you'd just give me your number and insurance, then I'll handle it.
Here. I'd better get a call from you.
Don't worry.
Why'd you run into me?
I didn't mean to. It was an accident.
You have completely damaged my car.
I did not. It looks perfectly fine.
You don't see what happened to my bumper?
What did I do to it?
You smashed my bumper in with your car.
I really don't think that I did that.
Your bumper looks exactly the same.
Look, just give me your insurance and number and I'll take care of it.
Give me your information, in case I don't hear from you.
Trust me.
Was there an accident on the freeway today?
You haven't heard about it?
No, do you know what happened?
This truck flipped over on the 210.
I'm telling you the truth.
Did anyone get hurt?
Two people were injured.
Are they going to be okay?
I think so.
That's a miracle that no one was killed.
Yes, they were lucky.
What happened today on the freeway?
You don't know what happened?
What did happen?
There was a truck on the freeway, and it flipped over.
I wouldn't lie about something like that.
Were there any injuries?
I heard that a couple people got hurt.
Are they all right?
The news said they should be fine.
I'm glad to know that everyone made it out okay.
I need to ask you something about my insurance.
Did you make any changes to my insurance?
What kind of changes are you referring to?
My premium isn't the same.
Is there a problem with your premium?
Did you guys raise my premium?
Yes, we did go up on the premiums.
Why wasn't I told of this change?
I apologize, and next time we will make sure to let you know.
I am inquiring about my insurance.
I think my insurance was changed.
What changes were made?
I think there's a problem with my premium.
It's higher than it was before.
I believe that the premiums did go up.
It would have been nice if I was notified of this.
I'm sorry about the inconvenience, and we'll notify you next time.
I have a question about my insurance.
What are you wondering about?
Were there any changes to my insurance?
What do you think was changed?
My premium is different.
I think that my premium went up.
We have raised the premiums.
You guys didn't think to notify everyone?
Next time we'll call and let you know.
Thanks for the favor.
I would like to purchase some health insurance.
Have you ever purchased health insurance before?
I have health insurance now, but I want to look into other choices.
Do you know if you are interested in an HMO or a PPO?
Could you explain the difference to me?
To clarify it for you, with a PPO you pay more but you get to choose your own doctor.
When I pay for a service, is the payment the same for a PPO or HMO?
The payments are quite a bit higher for the PPO, but you can go anywhere you like.
How much will an HMO cost me per month?
Go to our website and fill in the questionnaire. Once we have all of your information, we can give you a quote.
I am calling to purchase health insurance.
Do you have health insurance now?
I was on my parents' policy, but I need to start buying my own.
You can purchase an HMO or a PPO. Do you know what you want?
I don't know what I want.
Let me explain it to you. An HMO is a little cheaper, but you can only choose certain doctors.
When I go to the doctor, do I pay the same out-of-pocket expenses for a PPO?
The payments are a little lower for an HMO as long as you go to their doctors.
How much will a PPO cost me per month?
We need to factor in many things. Why don't you come in, and we will have you fill out a questionnaire.
I need information on purchasing health insurance.
Is this the first time you have had health insurance?
This is my first time buying health insurance.
You have a choice of HMO or PPO. Do you understand the difference?
I am not sure what those are.
Just so you understand completely: An HMO is a little cheaper, but you have limited choices of which doctor you choose.
If I need to use my insurance, are the payments the same for a PPO and HMO?
By going to the providers on the HMO list, you save money in out-of-pocket expenses.
Can you give me a comparison between a PPO and an HMO?
We can mail you a questionnaire and when we have all of your information, we will mail you a quote.
Oh, my God! It's my stomach. It's killing me!
Where does it hurt the most?
Right here! It hurts right here!
How long has it felt like this?
I felt OK when I woke up, and then, suddenly, I had this really sharp pain.
Do you have a history of stomach pain?
No, and I haven't done anything out of the ordinary.
I think that we are going to have to get you to an emergency room right away.
Thank you for helping me.
Can you tell me where it hurts?
I am so glad they called you. It feels like something is really wrong with my stomach!
Does it hurt when I push here?
It's mostly on my right side. Right here!
Have you been feeling this way for awhile?
I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner, but this morning the pain got really bad!
Have you eaten anything unusual lately?
No, not that I remember.
We are going to take you to an emergency room right now.
I will feel better when I know what the problem is. Thank you.
Where are you feeling the pain?
I can't stand up! My stomach is killing me!
Can you put your hand where it hurts the most?
It hurts smack in the middle of my gut!
Did this just come on suddenly?
I felt OK until an hour or so ago, and then I just doubled over.
Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently?
No, and I don't usually get a lot of stomachaches.
We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is.
I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this. Thank you.
Sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you could drive me to the emergency room.
Of course. What is the problem?
I am running a really high fever of 105 degrees, and I have a rash on my stomach.
If you can, go and unlock the back door, so I can get in when I get there if you fall asleep.
I can do that when I get off of the phone.
Do you know where your driver's license and insurance card are?
I already had them out before I called you.
Where is your nearest emergency room?
It's just a few blocks away.
Fine, I am on my way. I'll be there in about five minutes.
I hate to call you this late at night, but could you possibly help me get to the emergency room?
We will come right over. What happened?
My temperature went up to 105, and I have a rash!
Make sure that someone unlocks the back door, so I can get in if you fall asleep before I get there.
I will do that in a minute.
Make sure that you have your insurance card and driver's license where we can grab them.
I know right where they both are.
Is there an emergency room near you?
It is on the other side of town, next to city hall.
I am on my way. Give me ten minutes and I'll get to you.
I really need your help and want to know if you could drive me to the emergency room.
I will take you there right away. What is wrong?
I woke up with a rash and a temperature of 105!
I want to be able to get to you when I get there. If you can unlock the back door right now, that would be great.
I will make sure that I do that before you get here.
Also, make sure that we have your driver's license and insurance card before we leave for the emergency room.
I am getting them out while I am speaking to you.
Do you know where your nearest emergency room is?
It is near the bridge that crosses over the river.
I am driving to you even as we speak. Hang in there!
You don't look so good.
I have a major stomachache
Did you eat something strange?
I had spaghetti with clam sauce for lunch.
Maybe you have food poisoning.
Yes, that could have been it, but I haven't been feeling that great for the past few days.
Are you under a lot of stress?
Not really. Things have been going OK.
Maybe you have a touch of the flu.
I think that I might be getting the flu.
Are you feeling OK?
My stomach is bothering me.
What have you been eating?
I had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch.
Maybe the food had something wrong with it.
It could be bad food, but I didn't feel so well yesterday, either.
Have you been under a lot of pressure lately?
I haven't been under any more stress than usual.
Perhaps you have caught that bug that is going around.
I feel like maybe I am coming down with the flu.
You look kind of green.
I don't feel so good. I am feeling sick to my stomach.
Have you had anything to eat lately?
I had fried shrimp and clams for lunch.
Perhaps the food was bad.
Perhaps, but I haven't felt well for a few days now.
Has anything been upsetting you lately?
My stress level is pretty much what is usually is.
Do you think that maybe you are getting the flu?
It seems to me like I may have caught a bug.
Doctor, I have the worst toothache!
How long have you had this pain?
For about a week or so, but it's gotten really bad in the last couple of days.
Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth?
You know, I was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day, and I accidentally bit down really hard on one.
What kind of toothbrush do you use?
I just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush.
Does it bother you when you eat something really cold?
Yes, it definitely bothers me more when I do that.
So what brings you to my office today?
My tooth is killing me!
How long has your tooth been bothering you?
It just started hurting me last night.
Have you injured your tooth in any way?
I think one of my fillings might be coming loose.
Do you have a special kind of toothbrush that you like to use?
I have an electric toothbrush.
Does it bother you when you eat something really sweet?
Oh yeah, when I do that, it hurts a lot more!
How have you been doing?
I can't sleep or eat. I have a really bad pain in my tooth!
How long have you had this toothache?
It bothers me off and on, but it's gotten much worse these past few weeks.
Is there anything that you've done to your tooth that might have caused the pain?
My girlfriend told me that I grind my teeth a lot when I sleep. Maybe that is the problem.
When you brush your teeth, what do you use?
I use a soft bristle toothbrush.
Does it bother you when you have to chew a lot?
Absolutely. That set it off big time!
Excuse me, could you help me pick out a lotion?
Sure, what is the problem?
I got poison oak while hiking, and I need something to help me with the itching.
I can suggest a product called Technu that comes in a lotion or cream.
Which do you prefer?
Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer.
Is there anything else I can do to help with the itching?
You can take an antihistamine.
Thank you so much for all of the information.
You are welcome. Please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help.
I need help picking out a lotion.
It would be my pleasure to help you. What do you need help with?
I picked up some poison oak while hiking, and I can't stop itching.
We have Technu, and it is available in lotion or cream.
Do you find that one works better than the other?
I have heard that the cream is longer lasting.
Is there anything I can take that will help with the itching?
If you take an antihistamine, that would help a lot.
Thank you for helping me figure out what to do with my poison oak.
It was a pleasure. Come back anytime.
Can you help me find a lotion for a problem I am having?
That's what I am here for. What questions can I answer for you?
I have poison oak, and I need help with the rash that won't stop itching.
The best product is Technu, and you can buy either the lotion or cream.
Which one is best?
The cream form is very popular.
Can I do anything else to help with the itching?
You could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker.
I appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching.

I went hiking and have terrible poison oak.
When did you get that?

The doctor prescribed an ointment and gave me a shot.
Good. You probably should be much better by tomorrow.

This is Ryan you are speaking with. What can I do for you?
Hi, Ryan, this is Malia, and I will not be coming to work today.

Do you need someone to drive you home?
Thank you, but the bus stops right at my house.
Well, go home and rest up. Make sure you check the website for your assignments.
The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn.
Certainly, please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve.
What is this test for?
Well, today your doctor wants us to check your white blood cell count.
What does that tell him?
Well, if it is elevated, you might have an infection.
