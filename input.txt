Talking to a Counselor about Transferring
I need to talk to you about transferring.
Where did you want to transfer to?
What do I need to do in order to transfer?
You're going to need to finish your General Education.
How many classes is that?
The GE is 60 credits worth of classes.
Is that a lot?
You can finish in about two years.
Oh. That shouldn't be a problem at all.
Can I help you?
May I talk to you about transferring schools?
Where would you like to transfer to?
I haven't figured that out yet.
You have more than enough time to figure it out.
What must I do to transfer?
First, you have to complete your General Education.
How many GE classes are there?
You need 60 credits of GE classes.
If you work fast, you can finish in a matter of two years.
I wanted to talk to you about transferring.
You still have time to think about it.
What do I need to do in the meantime?
You'll need to finish your GE.
Exactly how many classes would I need to take?
You need to complete 60 credits worth of classes to finish your General Education.

That shouldn't be too hard.

Well, I was planning on transferring soon.
Where are you going to transfer?

That's all I need from you.
I can do that for you.
You're a lifesaver.
They'll be ready tomorrow.

I want to transfer pretty soon.
Where to?

I really appreciate your help.
Pick them up from me tomorrow.
Do you think that you can help me?
I'm going to be transferring schools soon.
That's great! Where do you want to transfer to?
That's wonderful, but what do you need from me?
I need you to write a couple of letters of reference for me.
Yes, that's it.
I'll have them ready for you tomorrow.
You got a letter in the mail.
Give it to me.
It's from NYU.
I didn't get accepted.
You can't be serious!
I'm serious.
Are you all right?
NYU was my first choice.
I'm sorry that you didn't get in.
I'll just have to wait for UCLA.
There's a letter here for you.
Let me see it.
What's the letter about?
It's a letter from NYU.
Tell me what it says!
I didn't get in.

I am really sorry to hear that.
It's okay. I'm still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway.
Have you figured out where you want to transfer to?
I can't think of where to go.
Where would you like to go to school?
I really don't know.
You can't think of anything?
I really like where I'm at now.
So, why don't you just stay here?
That may be what I'm going to do.
It's a perfectly good school.
You're absolutely right.
Do you know what you're going to do now?
I'm just going to stay at PCC.
Do you know where you want to transfer to?
I don't have the slightest clue.
What school would you like to go to?
You honestly have no idea?
PCC is perfectly fine for me.
You might as well stay here.
PCC is a wonderful institution.
So, what are you going to do?
I'm just going to keep going to PCC.
I can't seem to make a decision.
I honestly have no idea.
You haven't thought about it?
I like it here at PCC.
Why don't you just continue going to PCC?
I like that idea.
It's a great school.
I completely agree.
So, have you made your decision yet?
I'm staying right where I'm at.
It's my acceptance letter from UCLA.
I've been accepted!
NYU was my first choice, but UCLA is just fine.
I'm so proud of you.
Thanks. I'm proud of myself, too.
Here's a letter for you.
It's a letter from UCLA about my acceptance.
Read it!
UCLA accepted me!
I'm not joking. I got accepted!
I'm so happy for you!
UCLA was my second choice, but I'm happy knowing I've been accepted.
I am really proud of you.
You have no idea how proud I am of myself.
A letter came for you in the mail.
I think it's my acceptance letter from UCLA.
Did you get in?
I got in!
You're not kidding?
They really let me in.
Congratulations!
I really wanted to get into NYU, but UCLA is just as good.
You have no idea how proud I am of you.
I'm so excited.

Are you ready yet?
You're transferring tomorrow.
Yeah. I'm ready.
Are you nervous?

It's good to meet new people.
You're right. I should be okay.
You ready?
Am I ready for what?
Are you ready to transfer to a new school tomorrow?
Oh. Yes, I'm ready to transfer.
You're not nervous, are you?
I'm very nervous.
Why are you nervous?
I'm not going to know anybody there.
That's not a problem.
That makes me nervous.
It's fun meeting new people.
I didn't think about it that way.

Are you new here?
Is this your first year in college?
I actually transferred here from another school.

Do you like it here?
I really like it here so far.

I transferred from another school.
Where did you transfer from?
I was at PCC before.
Why did you transfer?
I was going to go here first, but my grades weren't good enough.
Did you like it at PCC?
PCC is an incredible school.
Well, I wish you luck here.
I'm sure I'll like it here.
This is my first day here.

Are you going to the party on Saturday?
I was thinking about it. Are you?
Yeah, I heard it's going to be a lot of fun.
Really? Well, what time does it start?
It starts at 8:00 pm, and I really think you should go.
Well, who else is going to be there?
Everybody from school.
How do you know it's going to be so fun?
This party is going to have a DJ, food, and drinks.
Wow, that does sound like it's going to be fun.
So am I going to see you at the party?
Yeah, I will be there.
Are you going to be at the party this Saturday?
I'm not sure yet. Are you going?
Of course I am, because it's going to be great.
Is it really? When does it start?
The party starts at 8 o'clock, and you should really try to go.
I'm thinking about it. Who is going to the party?
Pretty much everybody from school.

The party is going to have food, drinks, and live music.
That does sound like it will be fun.
Are you going to go?

Yes, I'm going, because it's going to be so much fun.
For real? What time is the party?
The party is at 8, and I hope to see you there.
Maybe I will go. Who's going to be there?
The whole school is going to be there.
What's going to be so much fun about this party?
There's going to be a live DJ, food, and drinks at the party.
It seems like it will be a very good time.
So I guess I'll see you there?
Indeed! I need to join the fun.
I am not sure. What are you doing?
I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach.
That sounds like a great idea!
Would you be interested in joining me?
Sure, I would love to go with you. When would you be leaving?
I thought that we could leave around 8:00 on Saturday morning.
That would give us plenty of time to explore. Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara?
That was part of my plan.
Well then, I'll see you on Saturday. Thanks for asking me to go with you.
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
I haven't given it much thought. What were you thinking of doing?
I was planning on taking a trip up the coast to the beach.
What a perfect thing to do on a beautiful weekend!
Would you like to come along?
I think I would enjoy that a lot. When would we leave?
Saturday morning around 8:00.
Good. That would get us there with time to look around. There is a music festival in Santa Barbara on the beach that day.
Yes, I was hoping to be able to go to the festival.
I am so glad we talked. Thank you for inviting me to the beach with you.
Have you thought about what you might like to do this weekend?
I have no idea. Do you have any ideas?
If the weather stays nice, I'd like to go to the beach.
That would be a good choice. The weather has been great for the beach!
Why don't you come with me?
Hey, that would be perfect! What time are you leaving?
I think that Saturday morning around 8:00 would work out well.
Santa Barbara has a music festival on the beach that day. We would have enough time to drop in and see it.
Yes, I knew the festival would be there and was looking forward to going to it.
I am really looking forward to Saturday. Thank you for letting me go with you.
Hey, Robert, what are you doing this weekend?
I didn't have any big plans.
We are putting together a birthday party for Mary.
That sounds like fun. Where will it be?
We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house.
Oh good! Can I bring anything?
We will be providing hot dogs, hamburgers, and cake, but people can bring side dishes.
I am assuming that the dress is casual.
Dress casually and bring your bathing suit!
Wonderful. Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there.
Robert, do you have plans for the weekend?
I have nothing definite planned.
Saturday is Mary's birthday, and we are throwing her a party.
Sure, I could come to her party. Where are you going to have it?
It's going to be a pool party at Jay's apartment building.
That sounds like fun. Is it a potluck?
We would like for people to help us by bringing side dishes and drinks.
The dress will be casual then?
Make sure to bring your bathing suit, and dress casually.
Sounds great. Just drop me an e-mail with the time you've picked.
Robert, are you going to be in town this weekend?
I don't have anything scheduled yet.
We were wondering if you would like to come to Mary's birthday party on Saturday.
I would enjoy coming to Mary's party. Will it be at your house?
The party will be at Jay's house out by the pool.
Will everyone be pitching in with some food?
It would be great if you could bring a side dish, but the rest of the food will be provided.
What should we wear?
This is a pool party, so make sure to bring your bathing suit.
Sounds like we'll have a great time. When you've figured out the details, drop me an e-mail.
Inviting Boss to a Dinner Party
Mr. Lee, I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next Friday night?
Yes, I think we might be free. What did you have in mind?
I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home.
That sounds great. Is it casual?
Actually, we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays.
That sounds good. It will give my wife a chance to dress up.
Yes, we've invited four other couples, so it should be a good mix of people.
That sounds wonderful. Will there be anyone there that I know?
Oh yes, everyone we are inviting is from our company.
Great! I'll look forward to it. We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation.
Mr. Lee, would you and your wife be free next Friday night?
I don't think we have any plans, but I would need to see what my wife has planned. Why?
My wife mailed a written invitation to your wife asking you both to our dinner party.
It would be our pleasure to join you for dinner. What type of party is it?
We've always wanted to have a formal dinner party.
I think we would enjoy that, especially our wives!
Four other couples are coming, so I'm hoping for some interesting conversation.
I am sure we will have a great time. Will some of the couples be from our company?
Yes, you will know all of our guests.
I'll make sure to check the mail for our invitation. Your dinner plans sound wonderful.
Would you and your wife be available next Friday night, Mr. Lee?
I'll have to check with my wife, of course. Did you have something planned?
We are having a dinner party, and my wife sent you and your wife an invitation.
I think we would enjoy that. Is it a formal affair?
My wife insisted on having it be a formal dinner party this time.
That would be a change. Usually we just do barbeques and never get a chance to dress up.
We thought that inviting four other couples would make nice conversation.
I think we will enjoy being there. Will we know anyone?
We are only inviting people from work.
I am sure that a good time will be had by everyone. We will be looking for your invitation.
Accepting Invitation to a Party
Joe, how are you doing today?
Pretty good. Mary, I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night?
I am free that night, and a party sounds good.
Fine. It will be at my house. Do you know how to get there?
I kind of know where you live, but could you e-mail me your address?
I can do that. Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party?
I would really like to bring my friend Jake, if that would be OK.
Oh yeah, I remember Jake. That would be fine.
Would you like some help with the food?
Just bring along whatever it is that you and Jake would like to drink.
Hi Joe, is everything going OK with you?
Things are great. Mary, I am having a party on Friday night and was wondering if you would be available?
I would love to come to your party!
I am glad you are free. Do you know how to get to my house?
If you would e-mail me your address, that would help.
Sure, no problem. Can you think of anyone else I can invite to the party?
My friend Jake is in town, and I would like it if I could bring him.
Sure, bring Jake along. The more the merrier!
Can I bring anything?
If there is something special that you and Jake would like to drink, bring that along.
Hey Joe, how's it going?
Oh good, Mary. I was hoping I'd see you today. Would you like to come to a party on Friday night?
A party would be a perfect way to end the week!
Good! Do you need my address?
I've been to your house once, but I would appreciate you e-mailing me your address.
That would be no trouble at all. Who else do you think I should ask to the party?
I don't know if you remember my friend Jake, but I would like to bring him with me.
Jake would be welcome. If you think of anyone else, feel free to bring them along also.
What would you like me to bring?
Everything is taken care of, but if you and Jake want to bring something to drink, that would be appreciated.
I need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday.
We have some fresh red roses.
How much are the roses?
Twenty dollars per dozen.
That sounds like a good deal.
Yes, that is today's sale price.
I'll take a dozen.
Is there anything else you'd like to get?
No, the roses will be fine.
I'm sure your wife will love them.
It's my wife's birthday, and I'm going to buy her some flowers.
Perhaps you'd be interested in red roses.
How much do the roses cost?
They're only $20 a dozen.
That sounds good, since last year I paid $30.
Yes, you're saving money because they're on sale today.
I'll take a dozen of your most beautiful roses.
Could I interest you in anything else?
No, I'll just give her the roses and a card.
She should be very pleased with these roses.
I need to buy some flowers for my wife's birthday.
Red roses are always a popular gift for birthdays.
What would the roses cost me?
You can get a dozen for only $20.
That's a price that I like.
You're in luck today because the roses are on sale.
I'll purchase the roses.
Perhaps you'd like something else to go with the roses?
No, the roses are good enough.
These roses sho
I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday.
Me, neither! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together?
Yes, that would be good!
We need to think about what she might like. What are her interests?
If I remember right, she likes music, skiing, and reading.
You know, maybe we could get her some concert tickets. Who would know her favorite groups?
Her roommate, Malia, might know what her favorite groups are.
Yeah, Malia would be able to help us choose a concert.
Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now.
Good! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift.
I can't figure out what to get Mary for her birthday.
I am having a problem figuring that out myself. Do you want to pick something out together?
Yes, that way we would have more money to spend.
She has a lot of interests. What things do you think she likes to do the best?
Well, she really likes going hiking, listening to music, and travel.
The music idea sounds good. I wonder who knows what concerts she might like to go to?
Maybe we could ask her roommate, Malia, who her favorite groups are.
Malia would be a great help. She has known Mary a long time.
Let's e-mail Malia and ask her for her suggestions.
I think that maybe Malia might like to contribute to this gift too.
I have been trying hard to pick out a cool gift for Mary for her birthday.
That's been challenging for me too. Would you like to go in with me and choose something together?
Yes, two heads are better than one.
What does she like to do? That might help us pick something out.
She seems to really enjoy music, getting pedicures, and going to the movies.
Maybe we could get her some concert tickets. Do you know who might know what concert she might like to go to?
I think that her roommate, Malia, could give us some suggestions.
Malia definitely could help us. She knows Mary very well.
I am going to see Malia this afternoon after class and ask her what she thinks.
That will work out well. Perhaps Malia would like to help buy this gift.
Welcome, Ron, come on in!
Hi, Malia! What a nice home!
We enjoy it too!
About four years now.
Well, it is very beautiful.
Ron, have a seat and I'll get us something to drink.
Good! I am really thirsty. You know it really is hot outside!
I have lemonade, iced tea, and mango juice.
Mango juice would be perfect. Thank you!

Ashley, what a great dinner party!
Thank you, Joe. What would you like to drink with your meal? I can offer you wine, mango juice, or water.
Just water would be fine.
Excellent choice. Can I dish you up some chicken?
Yes, the chicken looks wonderful!
How about some salad to go with your chicken?
Sure, I love salad!
Would you like to have rice with your chicken?
Yes, I think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken!
Good! Julie, if you could pass this plate down to Joe, I think we are all set.
What a wonderful dinner you've prepared, Ashley!
Thanks, Joe. Would you like some wine, mango juice, or water to go with your dinner?
I think that a glass of wine would be perfect.
Here is your beverage. If you pass me your plate, I can dish you up some chicken.
Yes, the chicken smells great!
Can I interest you in some salad to go with your chicken?
I would love to have some salad!
I also have rice. Would you like some rice on the side?
Yes, I absolutely love chicken and rice.
Excellent! If Julie could pass this plate down to you, we can dig in!
Oh Ashley, your dinner looks delicious!
I appreciate the compliment, Joe. What would you prefer with your meal--wine, mango juice, or water?
Mango juice would be a good choice for me.
Julie can pour your drink for you. Can I offer you some chicken?
Yes, that chicken looks yummy!
Would you like some salad to go with your chicken?

I have also prepared rice. Are you ready for some rice?
Yes, chicken and rice are a favorite of mine.
Good! Julie, could you pass this plate to Joe so we can get started?
Mary, it's good to see you!
Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by.
I am so glad that you decided to stop by!
Yes, it has been a long time since we have seen you.
Mary, can I get Josh or you something to drink?
Oh no, thank you. We aren't all that thirsty.
How about a little snack then?
No, thank you, we just ate lunch a little while ago.
Well then, how is your family?
Everyone is doing great. My sister finally had her baby.
Mary, what a surprise!
I am so glad you are home! Josh and I thought that we'd take a chance and stop by for a visit.
Your timing is perfect!
It's been a long time since we've stopped by.
Mary, Josh, would either of you like something to drink?
Thanks, but we really are fine.
Would you like a little snack?
No, thanks. We are still full from lunch.
Is your family doing well?
Things are going well for everyone. My brother finally got the job he had been trying for.
Mary, how have you been?
Josh and I just took a chance on our way home from the beach to see if you were up for visitors.
I was just thinking about you yesterday!
It's been ages since we had a chance to visit with you!
Mary, please let me get the two of you something to drink.
Oh, please don't go to any trouble. We just stopped by for a visit.
Can I get you a little something to eat?
We appreciate the offer, but we already ate.
So tell me, how is your family doing?
We are all doing well. My dad finally got to retire and is enjoying his leisure time.
Hi Julie, how are things going?
Everything is great, Tad. How are you?
I'm doing really well.
Tad, I'm pretty hungry right now. Want to walk over and check out the food table?
Julie, do you know who that woman is over there by the window?
That is Mary. I heard that she's just moved in with Lee.
I thought that he was with Malia.
Oh, that relationship is history. Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday.
I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that!
Actually, he was OK with it. They hadn't been getting along too well.
Hi Julie, how are you?
Things are going good, Tad. How about you?
Things have been going well for me.
That food smells delicious! Let's wander over to the food table and see what's up.
Julie, do you know who that woman talking to Lee is?
I think that her name is Mary. I think that she and Lee are moving in together.
Isn't he with Malia?
Malia dumped him. She ran off with a guy she met on vacation.
Lee was probably less than thrilled with that!
He was kind of relieved. They had been having some pro
Hi Julie, how have things been going for you?
I'm good, Tad. How are things with you?
Things couldn't be better right now.
Boy, that's quite a spread over on the food table! Let's go check out the party food.
Julie, who is the woman sitting next to Lee on the sofa?
Someone told me her name is Mary. Supposedly, she and Lee are living together in Lee's apartment.
What about his relationship with Malia?
Malia is no longer in the picture. She moved to Australia to be with a guy she met on vacation.
How did Lee feel about that happening?
He took it pretty well. I think that he had kind of had his eye on Mary for a while.
Their wedding was absolutely beautiful.
It really was. I want a wedding like that.
How much do you think they spent on their wedding?
I think it might've cost them a nice chunk of change.
Do you want a big wedding like that?
Not really. I'd rather have a small wedding.
I wouldn't want a small wedding.
I want my wedding to be big and memorable.
It can be small and memorable too.
Well, to each his own.
You are absolutely right.
Their wedding was just exquisite.
I know. Maybe one day I'll have a wedding like that.
What do you think their budget was?
It must have cost them a pretty penny.
Would you like to have a big wedding like they did?
No. I think I would prefer a smaller wedding.
I want a big wedding.
I want my wedding to be extravagant, and I want everyone to remember it.
Your wedding doesn't have to be big to be memorable.
Whatever floats your boat.
That is correct.
Their wedding was so beautiful.
I agree completely. I hope that I have a wedding like that one day.
How much do you reckon it cost to pull that wedding off?
I think it cost them a lot of money.
Do you hope to have a wedding as big as theirs?
I don't think so. I want to have a smaller wedding.
Not me.
Why do you want a bigger wedding?
I want to have a large wedding that everyone will remember.
You can have a small wedding, and people will still remember it.
Whatever flicks your Bic.
That is true.
Going to the Beach
Do you want to go to the beach tonight?
Sure, which beach are we going to?
I wanted to go to Malibu beach.
I like Santa Monica.
The water there looks so dirty.
I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica.
I like the pier too, because it's beautiful at night.
Is Malibu beach nice?
It's a lot nicer, and I really like it better.
So you want to go to Malibu?
If that's okay with you.
Sure, let's go to Malibu.
What do you think about going to the beach tonight?
I'd love to. Which beach?
It's up to you, but I was thinking Malibu beach.
I really like Santa Monica beach.
But the water there doesn't look too clean.
I only go because of the pier.
The pier is really nice at night.
How is it at Malibu beach?
I love Malibu beach, because it's so beautiful.
So is Malibu where you really want to go?
Are you cool with that?
Yeah, we can go to Malibu.
I want to go to the beach tonight.
That sounds like fun. Which one are you thinking about?
I was thinking Malibu, unless there is another beach you want to go to.
How about Santa Monica?
I don't really like that beach, as the water seems really dirty.
The only thing I like about that beach is the pier.
At night, the pier is absolutely beautiful.
What's it like at Malibu beach?
I love that beach, because it's just so nice.
So we're going to Malibu?
Well, if you don't want to go to Malibu, we can go to Santa Monica.
We can always go to Santa Monica another day.
Dating Discussion
Do you enjoy going on dates?
Yes. I find dates to be a lot of fun.
What's so fun about them?
They give me the opportunity to get to know someone better.
So you always have fun on dates?
Not always. I don't always like the person I'm on the date with.
My date may not be my type.
So then why would you ask them out in the first place?
I didn't realize until after our date that they weren't my type.
Sounds like a huge waste of time to me.
Now that I think about it, it really is sometimes.
Do you like dating?
It's really a lot of fun.
What makes it so much fun?
It makes it easier to get to know somebody.
Are dates always fun to you?
Sometimes I may not like the person I'm having a date with.
The other person isn't always my type.
Why would you bother going out with them then?
I didn't know that they weren't my type until after I got to know them better.
It seems to me that you're wasting your time.
You are absolutely correct, sometimes it is a waste.
Are dates fun for you?
I enjoy dating a lot.
Why are they so fun for you?
Dates allow me to meet new people.
Your dates are always fun?
Well, I don't always like who I'm dating; so not always.
The person I am dating may not be my type.
How come you asked them out if they weren't your type?
You don't always know what type of person you go on a date with until you know them well enough.
Dating sounds pointless.
Now that you mention it, sometimes you're right.
Well, I was just wondering if you'd like to go out this Friday.
Yeah, I was thinking we could get a bite to eat and catch a movie.
Of course, we can do something else if you'd like.
No, no, dinner and a movie sounds great.
Well, what time would you like me to pick you up?
How about 7:30?
That sounds good, so I'll see you then.
Okay, cool.
May I ask you a quick question?
How would you like to go on a date with me this Friday?
Seriously?
Well, I figured that we could go see a movie and get some dinner.
Cool, that sounds like it will be fun.
We can always do something else if you'd rather.
Not at all. I would love to go to dinner and a movie.
That's great, so what time do you want me to come get you?
Is 7:30 okay?
Friday at 7:30 sounds perfect.
Great. See you then.
Can I ask you something?
Sure you can. What's going on?
Would you go out with me on Friday?
Are you for real?
I thought that we could go to dinner and a movie.
That actually sounds like it would be a lot of fun.
Unless there's something else you would prefer to do.
Actually, I would really like to go to dinner and a movie.
What time do you want me to come by and pick you up?
Is 7:30 cool with you?
That's perfect, so I'll see you then.
Perfect. I will see you on Friday.
Hi, Todd, how is it going?
Things are going well. How are you, Mary?
I've also been doing well.
You know I've been thinking about maybe taking in a movie this weekend. Do you like to go to the movies?
Yes, I really enjoy movies.
Well, I've been hoping that we could spend some time together away from here. I was wondering if you would like to go out Friday evening for dinner and a movie.
Sure, that sounds good.
Is there any movie in particular that you might be interested in?
I was thinking about that movie, "Australia."
Yeah, that looks like one that we both might enjoy. If I picked you up at 7:00, would that work out OK for you?
Seven o'clock would be great!
Fine, then I'll see you at 7:00. I am looking forward to a great evening!
Hey Todd, how are you?
I've been doing well. How are things with you, Mary?
Things are good with me also.
Mary, I was looking in the paper at the new movies coming out. Do you enjoy movies?
Yes, I go all the time.
I was hoping that you and I could maybe spend a Friday evening together. I was wondering if you would like to go with me this Friday to see a movie and get a bite to eat afterwards.
I would love to go out with you on Friday.
Do you have a certain movie that you would like to see?
I've heard a lot of things about the movie "Australia."
You know, I was thinking that that would be a good movie to go see together. Would 7:00 be a good time to pick you up?
Seven o'clock would be perfect!
OK, I'll pick you up at 7:00 then.
Todd, how have you been?
Everything is good. How have you been, Mary?
Perfect, couldn't be better.
Mary, I was thinking that I might go to the movies this weekend. Do you go to the movies very often?
Yes, I like going to the movies.
Would you be interested in letting me take you to the movies on Friday? Maybe we could get a bite to eat afterwards.
I think I would enjoy seeing a movie with you on Friday.
I am not sure what movies are out right now. Have you heard of any that you might be interested in?
I think that that new movie, "Australia," looks like it might be good.
That movie sounded interesting to me too. If I picked you up at 7:00, would that be too early?
I think that seven o'clock will work out well.
Perfect! Well, I'll see you at 7:00 on Friday, then!
Meeting a Blind Date
Hi, are you Mia?
I am Mia. You must be Rubin.
Yes, that's me!
It's so good to finally meet you. Karen has told me so much about you!
I hope that she had good things to say about me!
She had only good things to say. Did you have trouble finding me?
Well, how many beautiful women in a red dress by the fountain are there?
Thank you for the compliment!
So would you like to go get a bite to eat, Mia?
That sounds perfect. Lead the way!
Hi, is your name Mia?
Yes, my name is Mia. Are you Rubin?
Yes, I am Rubin!
Finally! The infamous Rubin! I've heard so much about you that I feel like I already know you.
Oh no, I hope they had positive things to say.
Don't worry. All of the stories were good. How were you able to find me so quickly?
It was pretty easy to find the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain.
Well, I guess that kind of narrowed it down!
Mia, could I interest you in some lunch down the street at my favorite cafe?
Yes, it's a great day for a little walk and some lunch.
Hi, I am looking for a woman named Mia.
I think I am who you are looking for. You have got to be Rubin, then.
That would be me!
Rubin! Karen and Mike have spoken about you so often that I feel like I've met you before.
I hope that what they had to say was mostly good!
They only said wonderful things about you. You did a good job of finding me.
Finding the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain wasn't all that hard.
Yes, I guess it was a choice of me or the pigeons!
I was hoping that we could take a walk down the street to my favorite cafe.
Lunch sounds great! Let's head on out!
Calling After the Date
Hi Linda, this is Todd.
Todd, good to hear from you!
I just wanted to tell you what a great time I had with you at the movies last week.
Me too, Todd! Thanks for suggesting that great movie.
I also enjoyed it and was wondering if you would like to go for a hike in the mountains with me on Saturday.
I would love to join you on a hike. Could I maybe bring a picnic lunch for us to eat on the trail?
Sure Linda, that's a great suggestion.
Fine then, what time are we going to leave?
I was thinking maybe 9:00 or so, so that we could get started before the heat gets too bad.
Nine would be perfect. I'll see you then!
Linda, this is Todd calling.
Todd, I am so happy you called!
Linda, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed our time together last Friday night.
Boy, Todd, that was one great movie you picked out! Thanks for asking me to go with you!
I had a great time too and was thinking that maybe you might want to join me for a hike to the waterfalls on Saturday.
A hike would be great! Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch, OK?
Linda, that would be a perfect addition.
I'll take care of the lunch then, and you can take care of the other plans. What time would you like to pick me up?
I was hoping to leave by 9:00 so that it won't be too hot for the hike.
Nine is a great time to get started. I'll see you on Saturday!
Nine would be perf
An Argument
John, I was talking to the travel agent about where we might be taking our vacation this year.
I am going fishing in Alaska with my friend, Mark.
What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation?
You and I have been together for a whole year, and our vacation time should be about the two of us!
Really? Who made that rule up?
With that attitude, I don't really think we have much more to discuss here.
That works for me!
John, I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year.
I've already told my buddy, Mark, that I am going hunting with him in Alaska.
Hey, I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation. I am sorry that bothers you.
After a year together, I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together.
Says who? I don't think that is necessarily the case.
You know, now that I think about it, I really don't have much more to say to you at all!
Whatever you say!
Brian and Christina were mentioning that maybe it would be fun to go on vacation together this year, John.
I thought that I already told you that I am going with Mark to Alaska.
You know what? You and I had no plans, so I made plans with Mark. What's the problem?
We have been together for a year and usually, people who've been together a year, take their vacation together.
I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before. Any more rules that you would like to tell me about?
Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back, why don't you just move in with him as well!
I am really looking forward to getting away from you. Far away from you!
Joe, how are you doing?
I am great! How about you, Mary? How are you?
I am doing great! Thank you for asking, Joe.
I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight?
I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper.
OK. What about going to the movies on Friday night?
What were you planning on seeing?
I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer.
How about "The Secret Life of Bees"?
That's a chick flick!
Hi Joe, how are you doing today?
Things are going good today. How have you been doing, Mary?
Things are going well for me, Joe.
Want to go see a movie tonight?
My parents are taking me to dinner tonight.
Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night, instead?
What movie did you want to see?
There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer.
I was thinking that I would like to see "The Secret Life of Bees."
Oh great! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to!
Hi Kara, it's Mike here.
Hi Mike, how are you doing?
I'm doing well, and you?
Everything is going great.
Kara, would you be interested in going to dinner again this Friday?
Mike, I had a good time too, but I am getting ready to move back to the east coast, so I think I shouldn't get too involved right now.
Well, we could just go out as friends.
Right now, I think I need to really focus on matters at home, but thanks for a nice evening.
Hi Kara, this is Mike
Hello Mike. How are things going for you?
Great, how are you?
Fine. Everything is just fine.
Kara, I had a great time the other night and was wondering if you would like to go out again this weekend.
Mike, I enjoyed your company, but I am getting ready to graduate soon. I really need to focus on my studies.
Maybe I could help you with what you need to get done.
It would be better for me to just deal with getting my work done, but thank you for a lovely dinner.
A: Hello, this is Mike, Kara.
B: Mike! Good to hear from you. How are you?
A: Everything is fine, and how are you?
B: Things are going well with me.
A: Kara, I had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this Friday.
B: Mike, I don't think that it's a good idea to go out again. I really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home.
A: Maybe we could just meet for coffee or something.
B: I can't really deal with any distractions right now, but I appreciate the nice evening we spent together.
Scheduling an Apartment Viewing
Hi, can I speak with the apartment manager, please?
Hello, this is the apartment manager speaking.
I'm calling about the apartment for rent on Main Street.
Would you be interested in seeing the apartment?
I would love to see it.
Are you free today at around 6 p.m.?
Yes, I will be able to make it then.
Well, I'll see you at 6 p.m. Do you know how to get there?
I used to live in that area.
I'll give you an application form when I see you.
That sounds good. Do I need to bring anything?
No. Just bring yourself.
Hello, I was wondering if I could talk with the apartment manager.
I am the apartment manager. How can I help you?
I was wondering if the apartment on Main Street is still available.
Yes, it's still vacant. Are you interested in seeing it?
Yes, I would love to see the apartment.
I will be at the apartment today at 6:00. Can you make it?
Yes, I can be there at 6.
Great. I'll see you at 6. Do you know where it is?
Yes, I have a friend who lives in that neighborhood.
I'll be bringing an application form.
OK, should I bring anything with me?
No. I might need to see your ID card, but that's about it.
Could I speak to the apartment manager?
I wanted to know if that apartment on Main Street is still for rent.
I haven't rented it out yet. Would you like to see it?
Yes, I want to see it.
How about today at 6 p.m.?
That time is okay with me.
Very good. We'll meet at 6. Do you need directions?
No, thank you. I go by there on my way to work.
If you're interested, you can fill out an application form.
That's a good idea. Do I need to bring anything myself?
No. The only thing I need to see is your driver's license.
A Broken Window
This is Janet Smith in apartment 23. Can I speak to the apartment manager?
Hi. How can I help you today?
Well, my window facing the empty lot is broken.
Oh, that's not good. What happened?
I dont know. I wasn't home when it happened.
Do you have any clue who might have done this?
I have a feeling that it might have been the neighborhood kids.
Why, what leads you to that suspicion?
Well, next to the broken glass was a baseball.
Well, a baseball is certainly solid evidence.
I saw them playing just before I left my apartment.
Well, did you recognize any of them?
No, I just took a quick look.
Well, it'll take a couple of days to repair it.
A friend of mine is in the business. How about if I call him?
That's okay by me. First, let me come see the damage.
Come on over. So does my friend charge you or me?
Since you didn't break it, you don't have to pay for it.
That's a relief. I thought I was going to get stuck with the bill.
If I knew which kid did it, I would bill his parents.
I'm Janet Smith in apartment 23. Is this the apartment manager?
Hello. What can I do for you today?
My living room window is broken.
Are you serious? Do you know what happened?
I am not really sure, because I was out when it occurred.
Do you have any idea who might have been behind this?
Something tells me it might be some of the kids in the complex.
What led you to think it might be the kids in this building?
I found a baseball near the broken glass.
Well, you can't ignore a baseball in your living room, can you?
I saw them in the lot just before I went out.
Do you know any of them?
No, I didn't pay any attention to who they were.
I'll call the window repairman, but it'll probably take a couple of days.
I could get fast service if I call a friend of mine.
I don't have a problem with that. Let me look at the damage first.
Okay, I'm waiting for you. But who does my friend give the bill to?
Since the kids broke it, your friend can bill me.
Whew! I was worried that I would have to pay for it.
Believe me, if I find out which kid broke the window, I'll bill his parents.
This is Janet Smith in apartment 23. May I speak to the apartment manager?
Speaking. What can I do for you?
Something happened to my window. It's broken.
That doesn't sound good. Do you know how it happened?
I don't know the exact details.
Do you have an idea who might be responsible for the window?
I'm almost sure it is the local kids in the apartments.
How did you come to that conclusion?
There was a baseball in my living room along with the broken glass.
Well, at least there's no mystery about how it happened.
I saw a group of them playing in the lot just before I went out to my car.
Can you tell me which ones you recognized?
I just looked at them for a second.
I'll call a repairman, but it might take two days.
How about if I call a friend of mine who is a repairman?
That's no problem. I'll come by right now to look at the damage.
Okay. Come on over. But tell me, who pays for this?
You can pay for it, and I can reimburse you. Or he can bill me directly.
I'm glad to hear that. I didn't want to get stuck with the bill.
I will bill the kid's parents if I ever find out which kid did it.
Asking about Public Transportation
Can you give me a little more information about your apartment?
What kind of public transportation is near your apartment?
I'm not sure, but I believe there is a bus stop about three blocks away.
Do you know what direction that bus travels?
I'm sorry. If you check online, you can get that kind of information.
Okay, I'll just go online.
Okay. Good luck with your search.
Hello, I was hoping you could give me more info about your apartment.
I can try to help you. What would you like to know?
Is there access to public transportation near the apartment?
I'm pretty sure there's a bus stop within walking distance.
Do you know anything about the buses that stop there?
I don't know, but I'm pretty sure you can find out that stuff online.
I think the local library has bus info.
Good luck. The bus info shouldn't be too hard to find.
All right, what do you need to know?
What is the public transportation like near your apartment?
I don't use buses, but I think there's a bus stop a few blocks away.
Which route does the bus travel?
I wish I could help you, but I know nothing about the bus system.
I'll just check my phone book. It has lots of good information.
I'm sorry I couldn't help you more.
Interviewing a Potential Roommate
Hello, this is Albert.
Hi. I'm Jack. You called about the room for rent. Are you still interested?
I was wondering if I could ask you a couple of questions.
Shoot.
I just want to be sure that we get along.
I agree with you 100 percent--we must get along.
Are you a party animal?
Oh, no. I'm a very quiet person.
Great! Next: Are you neat or are you a slob?
I'm a pretty neat person.
Are you a night owl or a day person?
Early to bed, early to rise.
Finally, do you smoke?
Actually, I quit smoking four years ago.
Excellent answers. Do you have any questions for me?
Just one: Is there a parking lot?
Unfortunately, you have to park in the street.
Well, I'm desperate. I'll take it anyway.
Great! Let me know when you're ready to move in.
I think it will be tomorrow if that's okay.
No problem. I'll be here all day tomorrow.
Hi, this is Albert.
Hi, my name is Jack. You called about a room for rent. Are you still interested?
Yes, more than you know.
I don't mean to pry, but could I ask you a couple of questions?
Ask away.
I don't want us to be roommates who don't get along.
Yes, we must get along if we are going to be roommates.
Is partying one of your priorities?
I'm a student. I don't have time to party.
Very good. Now, do you clean up after yourself?
I clean up my own mess, and I expect others to do so, too.
What time do you usually hit the sack?
Occasionally, I stay up late if there's a big test the next day.
What about smoking?
If I ever get elected President, I will ban smoking nationwide.
Very good. Now, would you like to ask me anything?
Yes, I have one question. Do I have to park in the street?
I'm sorry. Yes, you have to park your car in the street.
I hate street parking, but I need the apartment now.
Very good. Just call me when you're ready to move your stuff over here.
How about if I come over tomorrow afternoon?
Just ring the doorbell. I'll be here all day.
Garbage Disposal
Hi, Tom. This is Hannah from apartment 4C.
Oh, hi, Hannah.
There is something wrong with my garbage disposal.
Exactly what's going on?
When I turn on the disposal switch, all I get is silence.
When did this happen?
Well, about a week ago is when it started sounding strange.
Did you accidentally drop something in the disposal?
No. I only use it about once a week. I hardly ever put anything into it.
Actually, I've heard that too little use is bad for a disposal.
Well, no one ever told me that.
Did you try to turn it with the disposal key?
I don't have a key.
Well, I've got a spare key, so I'll come over to show you how to use it.
Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it.
If the key doesn't work, I'll have to call the repairman.
Well, if it doesn't work, it's no big deal.
Yes, but if something's broken, I like to get it fixed ASAP.
Tom, are you there? It's Hannah from 4C.
Hey, Hannah. Long time no hear from.
My garbage disposal refuses to work.
What happens when you turn on the switch?
When I turn on the switch, nothing happens.
When did you first notice this?
A week ago it started sounding different.
Did you put something in it that you shouldn't have?
I use it rarely. When I do use it, I put pasta or other soft food into it.
Maybe you haven't been using the disposal enough.
Sort of like an air conditioner in your home or car?
Exactly. However, sometimes you can get it going again by using the key.
What key?
A disposal key. I've got a spare one, so I'll come over to show you.
If the key doesn't correct the problem, I'll have to call someone.
Well, like I said, I rarely use it so it won't be a problem.
Well, it's my nature to fix things as soon as I can.
Is anybody home? It's me--Hannah.
Hey, Hannah. How's everything going?
My garbage disposal isn't working.
Can you be a little more specific?
Nothing happens when I turn on the switch.
Do you remember how it started?
about a week ago I noticed a new sound.
You didn't drop a fork or anything into it, did you?
I don't use it very often. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it.
I've heard that disposals need to be run frequently.
That's interesting. I never heard that before.
Have you tried to turn it manually using the key?
I don't have a key, and I wouldn't know how to use it.
I've got an extra key. I'll show you how to use it.
I'm always willing to learn something new. Come on over.
The key might not work. Then I'll have to call the plumber.
If it works or doesn't work, it doesn't matter much to me.
Security Deposit
Yes, this is John Smith.
John, this is Terry Evans. I called to tell you I have good news.
Great, what is it?
The owner has approved your rental application. He enjoyed talking to you.
That's great. He seemed like a really nice guy.
Now, before you can move in, you need to pay some fees.
Fees, what kind of fees?
You know. First and last month's rent and security deposit.
Oh, those fees!
First and last is $2,500, and the deposit is $1,000. Just send me a check for $3,500.
No problem, what's your address?
Send it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107.
So, when can I move in?
The first of next month. Just stop by my office and pick up your keys.
Very good! Let me have your phone number.
Sure. It's 626-555-3000.
John speaking.
John, my name is Terry Evans. I have good news for you.
I'm all ears. What is it?
Your rental application has been approved. The owner thinks you'll be an excellent tenant.
Oh, that's so good. It makes my day.
Now, before you move in, you have to pay some fees.
Fees, what are you talking about?
You know--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit.
Oh, of course. When you said fees, I was thinking of parking fees or something.
That will come to $3,500, 2,500 plus $1,000. You can send me the check.
I'll do that immediately. Where do I send it?
Mail it to 3035 E Foothill Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91107.
One more question. When can I move in?
You can move in on the first. Stop by here and pick up your keys.
Great! What's your phone number?
My number is 626-555-3000.
I'm John Smith. How can I help you?
Hi, John. This is Terry Evans. I've got some good news for you.
I hope you're from the lottery. Go ahead.
The apartment owner was impressed with your interview. He has approved your rental application.
Oh, my gosh. That's wonderful news!
Of course, there are some fees to pay before you move in.
Fees? I don't remember anything about fees.
You know, the usual--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit.
But, of course. You cannot move in unless you pay such fees.
So, you can write me a check for $3,500. That's $2,500 and $1,000 deposit.
No sooner said than done. Where shall I mail it?
Just mail it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107.
So, when will I be able to move in?
Move in on the first. Come on by my office, and pick up your keys.
Sounds great! Tell me your phone number.

Warning about Late Rent Payment
Hello, Nicole here.
Nicole, this is Richard. I think you know why I'm calling.
Oh, it's about the rent.
Yes, this is the second month in a row.
I thought there was a grace period.
There is no grace period in the rental agreement.
Oh, I guess I forgot.
Well, when can I expect the rent?
You'll get it by Monday.
Don't forget the $50 late fee.
Is that in the rental agreement?
The late fee is circled in red ink!
Oh, Well, I can't find my copy of the agreement.
If you're late next month, I might give you an eviction notice.
Hi, this is Nicole.
Hi, Nicole. Richard here. I think you've got a good idea why I'm calling.
Yes. It's about the rent, isn't it?
Yes, your rent is late. This is the second month in a row.
But I thought that I had a grace period.
I told you last month that the rental agreement contains no grace period.
Oh, I guess I was thinking about the last place that I lived.
Well, tell me when I'm going to get your rent.
I get paid tomorrow, so you'll get the check by Monday.
Don't forget to include the $50 late fee.
Are you sure a late fee is in the rental agreement?
How could you miss the late fee? It's circled in red ink!
I can't find my copy of the rental agreement. I know it's somewhere in my apartment.
If you're late one more time, I'm probably going to evict you.
Hello, this is Betty.
Hi, Betty. Larry here. How many smoke detectors are in your apartment?
Actually, I have two.
Are the batteries fresh?
Both batteries are good.
Great. I need to come by and check them myself.
No problem, when are you coming by?
Thursday at noon. I'll let myself in if you're not there.
Okay, remember to lock my door when you leave.
I'll be in and out of there in just a few minutes.
Hello, Betty. This is Larry. How many smoke detectors are on your ceiling?
I have two smoke detectors.
Do you have fresh batteries in both of them?
Both batteries are pretty fresh.
Very good. I have to come by there and check out all the detectors.
Very good, when do you think you'll be coming over?
I'll be by on Thursday at noon. You don't have to be there.
I won't be home. Just remember to lock my door, okay?
You won't even know that I've been there.
Hello, Nicole? This is Jimmy in 309.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
You're not going to believe this.
Believe me, I think I've heard everything.
I can't find my mailbox key.
Is that all? That's a lot better than losing your car keys.
I had a duplicate, but I can't find it either.
If you come by my place, I can loan you a key.
There's no emergency. All I get is junk mail and bills.
Can you wait till Wednesday? I'll make you two more keys.
Sure, that'll be fine.
Okay. I'll see you Wednesday. But it's going to cost you $2 per key.
Can I speak to Nicole? This is Jimmy in apartment 309.
Hi, Jimmy. This is Nicole. What's happening?
You probably never heard this one before.
Don't bet on it. I've been an apartment manager for a long time.
I've looked everywhere, but I can't find my mailbox key.
Well, that's pretty minor. I lost my car keys and house keys once.
To make matters worse, I can't find my duplicate either.
If you want, come over here and I'll lend you a key.
No, there's nothing vital in the mailbox. Just junk and bills.
If you can wait until Wednesday, I'll make two more keys for you.
Wednesday's fine.
Okay, I'll bring them by Wednesday. Have $4 ready for me.
Hi, Nicole. This is Jimmy in 309.
Hello, Jimmy. Can I help you?
I've got a little problem.
Tell me your problem, and maybe I can help.
As if that wasn't bad enough, I also misplaced the duplicate.
Well, if it's an emergency, come by here and I'll lend you a key.
No, even if there's a bill in there, it can wait.
If you don't mind waiting until Wednesday, I'll make two more keys for you.
Oh, I can wait, believe me.
Okay, see you Wednesday. They're not free, you know. It'll be $4.
Calling the Landlord about Moving Out
Good afternoon, Jim. This is Olivia.
Oh, hi, Olivia. How can I help you?
I'm going to be moving out.
Oh, really? When are you leaving?
I'll be leaving on the last day of June.
Any particular reason?
I got a new job.
Congratulations! What is it?
I'm going to be an ESL instructor at Pasadena City College.
Great! By the way, what's ESL?
ESL stands for English as a Second Language.
Well, I'm glad it wasn't your neighbors causing you to move.
Just because they play their TV loud enough for the whole complex?
Yes, I know. I'm going to have another talk with them.
Anyway, it's been nice knowing you for these past few years.
You, too. Keep in touch, and good luck with your new job.
How's it going, Jim? This is Olivia.
Hello, Olivia. What's up?
I wanted to let you know that I have to move out.
I'm sorry to hear that. When are you moving?
The thirtieth of June.
May I ask why you're leaving?
I found a new job.
Good for you! What's your new job?
I am an ESL teacher at Pasadena City College.
Very good! What does ESL mean?
ESL means English as a Second Language.
Well, I'm glad you're not moving because of your neighbors.
I can't tell you how happy I'll be not to have to listen to their TV.
Yes, I'm going to tell them one more time to turn down their TV and keep it down.
You've been a good apartment manager and a good person. I'll see you in June.
Thank you. I hope your new job and new apartment are good for you.
Hey, Jim. How are you? Olivia here.
Hi, Olivia. What's going on?
I just wanted to give you notice that I'm moving.
Oh, that's too bad. What's the moving date?
I'll be gone on the last day in June.
Can I ask you why you're moving?
I've been looking for a long time, and I finally found a good job.
Very good! What's your new job?
I'm going to teach ESL at Pasadena City College.
Good for you! What does ESL stand for?
ESL is English as a Second Language.
Well, I'm glad you don't feel you're being chased out by your neighbors.
Their TV is so loud you'd think they were stone deaf.
I'll tell them one more time to turn down their TV. Then I'm going to evict them.
Thanks for all your help over the past few years.
Thanks. Good luck with your new neighbors and your new job.

Sure, I'll go look at apartments with you anytime you want.
Subleasing
I heard that you're looking for an apartment.
Yes. Who told you that?
A friend of ours told me.
Why are you asking?
I was asking because I found an apartment.
Why are you telling me this?
I was wondering if you wanted to sublease with me.
I sure would!
Since we're subleasing, we can each pay half of the rent.
How much is the rent each month?
It's $1000 a month.
That's wonderful.
Are you still looking for an apartment?
Who said I was?
One of our friends let me know.

It's $1,000 each month, but it'll only cost us $500 a month each.
I like the sound of that.
Is it true that you're looking for an apartment?
I am. How'd you know?
I heard it from one of our friends.
Well then, why do you ask if I'm looking for an apartment?
I was thinking about leasing this apartment.
What does this have to do with me?
Would you like to sublease the apartment with me?
I would love to!
This way, we'll each have to pay only half the rent.
How much is the rent?
For each of us, it's $500 every month.
Sounds good to me.

Sure. What would you like to know?
In all honesty, the neighborhood could be a little nicer.

You can actually see the whole apartment for yourself.
I don't have the time to go see the apartment.
Actually, you can view this apartment online.

I can give you the website to view that apartment on.
That is really convenient.
That's the reason we made the website.
I was wondering about the apartment.
Could you give me details about the apartment?
What is it that you would like to know?
Actually, it's the floor plan that I am inquiring about.
If you would like to, you can see it for yourself.
I am very busy and don't know when I can view the apartment.

That would be more convenient than having to go all the way down there.
Convenience is the reason that we made the website.
Could you help me with a question that I have about the apartment?
I would like to know about the apartment.
What exactly did you want to know?

Thank you so much for all your help.
Good morning, is this the Renter's Hotline?
Yes, what can I help you with?
I have a question about discrimination in housing.
What type of discrimination?
I think that he doesn't want to rent to me because of my race.
What made you think that your race was a problem?
He seemed OK talking to me on the phone, but seemed to change his mind when he saw me in person.
What else made you feel he was discriminating against you?
Well, he had a 25 unit apartment building and everyone I saw there was his same race.
Racial discrimination is very hard to prove, but if you would like to come down, we can go over a checklist that can help you build a case.
I would like to speak with someone in the Housing Department.
You have reached the right area. Can I help you with something?
I think that I may have experienced discrimination in trying to rent an apartment.
Can you be specific as to what type of discrimination?
I felt that he didn't like me because I wasn't the same race that he was.
How come you feel it was race that was the issue?
When I showed up on his doorstep, he seemed bothered by my appearance.
Is there anything else that made you feel he was using race as a factor in who he rented to?
As I walked through the apartment building all I saw were people who were the same race as the manager.
It is not easy to prove racial discrimination, but please go to our website which can help you file a formal complaint.
Hello, is this the Legal Advice Line?
You are in the right department. What can I do for you?
I think that the landlord where I am trying to rent an apartment may be discriminating against me.
Discrimination is a pretty broad term. What type, specifically?
I have a feeling that he will not consider my application because of my race.
Are you sure that race was the issue? What makes you feel this way?
When he saw me in person, he seemed bothered by me although I seemed to be under consideration when I e-mailed him.
Do you have any proof that he would not rent to you because of your race?
I didn't see one person in that whole building who wasn't the same race as the manager.
It is difficult to prove racial discrimination, but you may file a formal complaint in our office.
Making an Appointment for an Apartment Viewing
How are you today?
Great, thanks.
I would actually like to view the apartment for rent today.
I'm sorry, but you won't be able to view it today.
You have to make an appointment first.
Oh, okay. Can I do that right now?
Is this Friday okay?
Is 6 o'clock Friday evening okay?
Yes, I will schedule you for that time.
Thank you very much. See you then.
Is it possible for me to view the apartment today?
Unfortunately, you will not be able to view it today.
Why can't I view it today?
You'll need to make an appointment to view the apartment.
I understand. May I make an appointment then?
How does this Friday sound?
Friday at 6:00 pm would be perfect.
That will be fine.
Thanks for your help.
I'm fine, thank you.
Did you need help with something?
If I could, I would like to view the apartment sometime today.
That won't be possible today.
You can only view the apartment with an appointment.
I would like to make one right now if I can.
Are you available this Friday?
Can we do it at 6 o'clock?
Your appointment for Friday at 6:00 pm has been confirmed.
All right. I'll see you on Friday.
Talking about the Lease
I need to talk to you about something.
What did you need to talk about?
I have some questions about my lease.
Exactly how long is my lease for?
Your lease will be up in three years.
What will happen if I move out before then?
If you move out before then, you will not get your deductible.
Because our contract says that you will live here for three years.
Okay, I think that I understand.
I'm glad you understand.
Can we talk?
I'm not too clear on some things about my lease.
How many years is my lease for?
In three years your lease will be up.
Can I move out before those three years?
If you do, I will keep your deductible.
Why would you keep it?
I would keep it because you would be breaking our contract.
I get it now.
I hope that I cleared things up for you.
I would like to talk to you, if you have time.
I want to discuss some things about my lease.
What aren't you too sure about?
Can you tell me when my lease is up?
Your lease is for three years.
If I ever decide to leave before the three years, will there be a problem?
If you break the contract, then you will not receive your deductible.
All right. I'm glad I could clarify things for you.
I would love to rent this apartment.
I'm happy to hear you say that.
How much are you asking for every month?
I'm renting this apartment out for $1050 a month.
That is quite a lot of money for just one month.
That is a fair price.
What do you say to $850 a month?
It's either $850 or nothing at all.
I won't go any lower than $1050.
Could you please go lower?
That's the best I can do.
This apartment is wonderful.
I'm glad you like it.
How much would I have to pay for rent?
The rent is $1050 each month.
That's way too much money.
It isn't too much.
How about if I pay $850?
I can't take that.
I can't go any higher than $850.
I honestly don't know what else to tell you.
You can't go any lower than that?
If you can't afford $1050, then we have no deal.
I think I may rent this apartment from you.
How much are you looking to rent it for?
For each month you would have to pay $1050.
That is too expensive.
I don't think that is too much for rent.
How does $850 a month sound to you?
That's not enough.
That's the best that I can do.
$850 a month is not enough money.
Would you please reconsider?
That's my final offer. Take it or leave it.
I would love to rent out your apartment.
The rent each month is $1050.
Did you have a better price in mind?
What about $800?
That's way too low.
I can't pay much more than that.
How about $900 a month?
Great. It was a pleasure doing business with you.
That would be wonderful.
Can you tell me how much I would have to pay for rent?
The rent is $1050 every month.
That's way too much.
What is good for you?
I can afford about $800 a month for rent.
That's not high enough.
How much more are you thinking?
I can let it go at $900 a month.
That's almost perfect.
I can live with that too.
I want to rent this apartment.
You will have to pay $1050 every month.
I can't afford that.
What can you afford?
I was thinking $800 a month.
I'll need you to pay more than that.
How much more?
How does $900 every month sound to you?
I can live with that.
We have a deal then.
Policy Towards Pets
I was wondering if you allow pets in this building.
We do allow some pets, but you must pay an additional five hundred dollar security deposit.
What kind of pets do you allow?
You may keep either one cat or one dog.
Can cats and dogs be outside?
Cats can be outside, but we want them collared or tagged so we know who they belong to. Dogs must be on a leash and are not allowed in the flowerbeds.

Checking the Apartment for Anything Damaged
Do you like the apartment?
I absolutely love the apartment.
Everything is okay?
I do have one problem with the apartment.
I don't like all those stains in the carpet.
We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment.
I did not know that.
I assure you that we will, and if there are any more problems, feel free to tell me.

What a great opportunity to get oriented to the neighborhood!
It starts around ten. Just meet me in the parking lot around 9:45, and I'll take you there.

You may have one roommate, but they need to have an approved application on file with us.

Have you spoken to them about the noise problem?
No, I haven't spoken with them about it.
What else do you hear that bothers you?

Asking the Neighbor Not to Make Noise
I was meaning to talk to you about something.
Were you having a party in your apartment last Friday?
Yes, I had a little party.
It was very loud.
I didn't intend on being too loud.
It's fine if you want to have people over, but I couldn't sleep with the noise.
I really do apologize for all the noise.
Next time, do you think that you could keep it down?
Will do.
Okay, and once again I'm sorry for keeping you up.
May I talk to you?
Did you have a party Friday?
I did have a few people over.
It was way too loud.
I didn't realize I was making a lot of noise.
I couldn't sleep with how loud it was.
I'm sorry for being so loud.
Could you try not to be so loud the next time?
I'll make sure to do that for you.
Thanks, I would appreciate it.
Let me apologize again for the noise.
We really need to talk.
What do we need to talk about?
Was there a party going on in your apartment on Friday?
I did throw a party on Friday.
You were quite loud.
I really didn't mean to be loud.
I don't mind if you have company, of course, but the noise made it difficult for me to sleep.

It's all right, but next time could you try to keep it down?
I will try to.
Thank you, because that would be great.

Poor Area Lighting
I would like to speak with the manager about some safety concerns.
This is the manager. What can I do for you?
I was parking my car last night in the garage area, and it was very dark out there.
Is this the first time you noticed this?
The lighting has always been bad, but it seems to be getting worse.
We are trying to save electricity, so we put in new energy-saving bulbs. Maybe that was the problem.
Whatever the problem is, it needs to be fixed.
Why do you feel this is so unsafe?
It is unsafe because it allows people to hide in there and jump people and rob them.
I will go out there after dark and check it out. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.
Could I speak with the property manager about a problem I had last night?
I am the property manager. What was the problem that you experienced?
Have you noticed that the lighting in the garage area is almost nonexistent?
Has this been a problem for you in the past?
I just moved here recently, so I really don't know how long it has been like this.
Maybe some of the bulbs were burned out.
All I know it that it feels very unsafe out there at night.
Do you really think it is that unsafe to have a few dark patches here and there?
It is unsafe because a rapist could hide in there and attack women.
I will have the night manager look into it. Thank you for telling me about it.
I had a problem last night in the parking lot and would like to speak to the manager.
This is the manager speaking. How can I help you?
I got out of my car in the parking area, and the area was not lit very well.
How long have you noticed this problem?
This is the first time that I noticed it.
Maybe you were just parking in a shadowy area.
Regardless of the cause, the problem needs to be taken care of.
I am not sure that having a few shadows here and there is such a problem.
It is unsafe because people can't see where they are walking and could have an accident.
When it gets dark tonight, I will take a look. I appreciate your concern.
Recreation Area Problems
Could I speak with the manager about some problems in the pool area?
My apartment is next to the pool, and there seems to be some really late-night partying going on out there.
The hours for the pool are eight in the morning to ten at night. Is the noise that you are hearing later than that?
Yes, sometimes people are in the Jacuzzi at midnight!
Did you call the night manager?
No, I didn't really know if anyone was around that late.
I am going to give you my number to call if it happens again.
You are welcome. I will be sending letters to tenants to remind them of the rules.
I had some concerns about the pool and Jacuzzi area and would like to speak with someone.
I can help you with that. What are you having problems with?
I live right next to the pool, and late at night it is really noisy out there!
There is not supposed to be anyone in the pool area after ten o'clock at night. Are you noticing people out there any later?
I've heard people out there at one in the morning!
Did you contact anyone?
No, I just waited until now to tell you.

You are welcome. Evidently a few people need some reminders.
I was wondering if I could speak to someone about some concerns of mine with the pool area.

The pool is supposed to be closed after 10:00. Are you saying that people are partying later than that?
There have been parties out there that haven't ended until two in the morning!
Did you call the front desk?
Yes, I tried, but no one picked up.
You can have my personal line to call if this happens again. Do not hesitate to call.
Thank you for taking care of this for me.
Thank you for bringing it to my attention. We will send reminder memos to help people remember what the rules are.

Just in case you have to leave, we will just use the master key.
I need to talk with the property manager right away!
This is the property manager. What seems to be the problem?
This morning, when we woke up, there was water pouring in from the ceiling!
Could you tell me what room had the leak?
There were several rooms, but the worst leak was in the bathroom.
Could you please remind me which floor you are on?
We are on the second floor, one of the middle floors.
I will be sending the assistant manager to check it out. May we look at it this morning?
Actually, I have to go to school right now.
If you aren't there, we will use our master key to get in and check things out.
Plumbing
I am having some plumbing problems and need them fixed.
What exactly is wrong with the plumbing?
The toilet flushes really slowly.
Are there any problems with the plumbing in the kitchen?
Both the kitchen and the bathroom plumbing are messed up.
How long have you had these problems?
It has been going on for a while, but just started to get worse this morning.
I will send someone out to take a look at the problem. Will you be home this afternoon?
Yes, I will be home this afternoon.
Fine. I will be there around 2:00. If someone is not there, I will use my key to get in.
I just moved into my apartment, and the plumbing is not working.
Can you describe the plumbing problems you are having?
The bathtub barely drains at all.
Okay, the bathroom plumbing needs looking at. What about the kitchen plumbing?
Neither the kitchen nor the bathroom plumbing is working well.
Has this problem been going on for a long time?
It just started happening last night.
I will be coming over to look at it this afternoon. Will you be there?
I will not be home.
I can always use my key to get in, but I would prefer that you be there.
The plumbing in my new apartment is not working.
I need you to tell me what the problem is.
The bathroom sink is stopped up.
Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also, or just the bathroom plumbing?
Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem.
Did this just start happening, or has it been going on for a while?
Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago.
Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem?
I am not sure if I will be home later.
I will be coming by around 10 this morning. If you aren't there, I'll just use my key.
Threatening not to Rent
Do you like the apartment so far?
I see a problem.
I noticed that the faucet in the kitchen is leaking.
That's no big deal.
It's going to be a problem when my water bill comes.
What do you want me to do about it?
I would like you to fix the problem.
I won't be able to do that right now.
Well, I won't be able to rent the apartment until the problem is fixed.
Fine, I'll have it fixed for you.
I'm happy that we've come to an agreement.
How do you like the apartment?
I like the apartment, but I see something wrong with it.
There's a leaking faucet in the kitchen.
That isn't a problem.
That leak is going to raise my water bill.
What can I do?
You need to fix it.
I can't right now.
I won't rent it if the faucet isn't fixed.
I will fix it for you.
I'm glad you finally agree.
What do you think of the apartment?
I like it, but there is one problem.
What problem is that?
The faucet in the kitchen is leaking.
I don't understand what the big deal is.
That leak is a problem for my water bill.
What you would like me to do about it?
The leak must be fixed.
I won't be able to fix it at the moment.
I will not rent the apartment with that leaking faucet.
If that's the case, then I will fix the faucet.
Thanks for understanding.
I would like to make an appointment to discuss the problems I keep having with my apartment.
Are you having problems? This is the first I've heard of it.
We gave you a list of problems last week.
What kind of problems are you talking about?
The garbage disposal doesn't work, we have rats, and the toilet is backed up.
Maybe I could get back to you in a few weeks. I am leaving on vacation this afternoon.
These things are your responsibility, and you need to fix them immediately.
Don't tell me what to do! I'll get to it when I get around to it!
If these problems are not addressed immediately, I will be contacting the health department this Friday.
I'll be right over!
We would like you to stop by again so we can show you some more problems that have come up with our apartment.
I am kind of busy right now, but maybe later next week I could stop by.
We sent you an e-mail the first week we moved in; it listed the problems we found.
What problems did you find?
The roof leaks when it rains, there is mold on the bedroom walls, and the dishwasher doesn't work.
I don't really consider any of that to be my responsibility. You can fix those things yourself.
Maintaining basic health and safety standards is your responsibility.
I am maintaining the building. You are way too picky!
Unfortunately, you won't be getting a rent check unless these problems are fixed by Friday.
You wouldn't dare do that!
You really need to look at some of the problems we are having with the apartment.
That apartment never had any problems before. Are you sure the problem isn't you?
We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix.
Where do you think you have problems?
There is no hot water, the bedroom has a broken window, and there are rats in the kitchen.
You know, no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before.
You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment.
I will fix these problems when I get around to it.
I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately.
You can't do that! It's illegal!
Asking the Landlord about Fixing a Problem
I'm having a problem.
A pipe burst in my wall.
Is the pipe causing any water damage?
The water is causing mildew.
I can come fix the pipe sometime tomorrow.
Can I just call someone myself to fix it?
I don't think that would be a good idea.
You won't do it until tomorrow.
I guess you have a point.
So, I can call someone to fix it?
Go right ahead.
I have an issue.
There is a leaking pipe in my wall.
Is there any water damage?
There is mildew.
I'll go to your apartment tomorrow to fix the pipe.
Why can't I call someone to fix it today?
I'll just do it myself.
I need it done today.
You're right about that.
Are you okay with me calling a plumber?
There is a problem in my apartment.
A pipe broke in my wall, and water is leaking.
Is the water causing any damage?
Yes, it's creating mildew on the walls.
I won't be able to fix the pipe until tomorrow.
I can call a plumber to fix it right now.
I'll do it for you.
You can't do it until tomorrow, and I need it fixed now.
You're okay with me calling someone?
I'm all right with that.
Explaining the Problem to the Plumber
Thank you for coming.
You're welcome. What's the problem?
I have a leaky pipe.
Where exactly is the pipe?
The pipe is behind a wall in my bathroom.
How long has the pipe been leaking?
It began leaking a couple of days ago.
I must tell you that in order to get to the pipe, I must tear down that wall.
That won't be a problem?
Not as long as it gets fixed.
All right, I will start working now.
No problem. What's wrong?
A pipe in my apartment is leaking.
Where is the pipe?
The pipe is in my bathroom.
Can you tell me how long the pipe has been leaking?
The pipe has been leaking for a couple days.
You do realize that I will need to rip down your wall to get to the pipe, right?
Yes, I'm aware of that.
Is that all right?
I just need the problem fixed.
I'll get started on it now.
I'm glad you could make it.
It's my job. What can I help you with?
I think a pipe burst in my apartment.
In what room is this pipe?
You'll find the pipe in my bathroom.
When did the pipe start leaking?
It's been leaking for a couple of days now.
I will need to tear down that wall to fix that pipe.
I understand.
You're fine with that?
I just want the problem taken care of.
Okay. I will begin working on it now, if you'd like.
Calling the Police about a Burglary
Thank you for coming, officer.
I was in school all day and came home to a burglarized apartment.
Was the door locked when you left?
The door was still locked when I came home, so maybe they came in through a window.
Do you live here alone?
I have a roommate, but she is still at school.
Have you seen anyone suspicious in the neighborhood?
No, nothing unusual.
Well, I am going to check the windows and look for fingerprints. I want you to figure out what is missing.
I appreciate you coming so quickly, officer.
Whoa, what a mess! What happened here?
Apparently while I was at school today, someone decided to help themselves to the contents of my apartment.
Was everything locked up when you left?
I think that they broke in through a window.
Do you have a roommate?
My boyfriend lives here with me, but he is out of town right now.
Have you noticed anyone unusual around lately?
Actually, my neighbor asked me if I knew who was parked across the street the other day.
Let's go through your rooms and try to figure out what has been taken.
Thank God you are here, officer.
I came as soon as I could. What a mess!
When I left for school today, everything was fine. Then I came home to find my apartment had been broken into.
Was the door locked when you came home?
I don't think they came in through the door; maybe they entered through the window.
Does anyone else live here?
I live here alone.
Have you noticed any strangers or parked cars around here recently?
I really haven't been home very much lately.
Let's figure out what is missing and see if there are any fingerprints left behind.
Talking about Apartment Upgrades
I really like the apartment, but I was wondering if I could change some things.
What would you like to change?
I would like to have different carpet.
I would be willing to put in a different color carpet if you pay the price difference.
How much more would it cost?
It would cost between 2 and 10 dollars more per square yard.
While I am at it, would it be possible to switch paint colors?
I would be willing to look at a different color. You need to bring me a sample.
When can my apartment be painted and ready to go?
You can have the new carpet and paint by next Monday.
This apartment is great, but could I upgrade a few things?
What are you unhappy with?
I want to have a different color carpet.
If you agree to pay more money, you could upgrade the carpet.
Would it cost a lot more?
It could be as little as 2 dollars or as much as 10 dollars more per square yard.
I was also wondering if it would be possible to pick a different paint color.
Bring me a paint sample to look at, and I will consider it.
When can you finish with the new carpet and paint?
Your new apartment can be recarpeted and repainted by next Tuesday.
I think that I would enjoy living here, but I would like to make improvements.
What would make this apartment better for you?
I think that it would look better with a better quality carpet.
You can have a different carpet, but you have to pay more if it costs more.
How much more would it cost to upgrade?
It could vary quite a bit, between 2 and 10 dollars per square yard.
Do you think that I could have a different paint color in my apartment?
I have to see a sample. Bring me one this week, please.
How long will it take for my new apartment to be ready?
Both the new paint and new carpet will be finished by next week.
Moving Out
Great. What's up?
I wanted to talk to you about something.
What did you want to talk about?
I just wanted to let you know that I'm moving out.
When?
In the next few weeks.
I don't understand why you want to move.
I'm going to school out of state.
I see. That'll be fine.
Yes. I'm fine with it.
I'm all right. What did you need?
When exactly are you planning on moving out?
I'm going to be moving in a few weeks.
Why are you going to move?
I'm leaving the state to go to school.
I can understand that.
So you're fine with it?
Eviction Notice
I received an eviction notice from you, and I don't understand what it means.
Well, you are behind in your rent; it's a 30-day notice to vacate.
You can't make me move just for being late with my rent.
You have been late with your rent several times now. I am filing suit for back rent to protect myself.
Are you throwing me out?
This notice is to let you know that you will be evicted by a sheriff if you don't make good on your rent.
If I catch up on my rent, can I stay?
You can stay if you catch up and stay caught up. Otherwise, I will find another renter.
I will go get the money right now.
Thank you. Please make sure that you pay with cash or a cashier's check.
I opened my mail, found this eviction notice, and don't know what to do with it.
Actually, it is a 30-day notice to vacate the premises.
Just for being a few days late?
This isn't the first time you have been considerably late with the rent. I need to start the procedure to evict you.
Are you taking my apartment away?
This is a notice to inform you that the sheriff will evict you in 30 days if you do not pay up on your rent.
Can I keep the apartment if I pay my rent in full?
You can keep the apartment if you stay caught up on your rent. Otherwise, I need to find someone who can make the payments.
I will go write a check right now.
Thank you. I will need a cashier's check or cash, please.
What is this eviction notice for?
The notice you received is a 30-day notice to vacate.
I mentioned to you before that you need to keep up with your rent. This notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business.
You can't just throw me out on the street!
You have 30 days to catch up on your rent, or a sheriff will evict you.
Will you still throw me out if I make the rent payment?
You can stay, but you might think about looking for a less expensive living arrangement if you are having trouble making the payments.
I am going to take care of the rent payment right now.
Thank you. The payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier's check.
Getting the Deposit Back
I'm moving out.
Your lease isn't up yet.
I won't be able to stay here anymore.
That's going to be a problem.
I don't know why there's a problem.
It's a problem because I can't give you your deposit back.
Why can't you give it back to me?
You're breaking our contract.
I'm going to need my deposit back.
That's not going to happen.
I can't stay here, though.
That's really not my problem.
I have to move.
You have not fulfilled your lease agreement yet.
I can't stay here anymore.
There's a problem with that.
I won't be able to give you back your deposit.
This was stated in our agreement.
But I need it back.
I can't do it.
It will be impossible for me to stay here.
That's not my fault.
I'm going to be moving out soon.
You still have time on your lease.
There's no way that I can stay here.
That's not going to be all right.
I don't understand why.
I'm going to have to keep your deposit
Why can't I have it back?
Because you're leaving before your lease is over.
You have to give it back to me.
You're not going to get it.
But I'm not able to live here anymore.
I can't help you with that.
Asking about Where to Get Off
This bus goes all the way to Santa Anita mall, right?
Yes, it'll take us there.
Are you positive?
I always catch this bus.
How long is this bus ride?
It only takes half an hour.
Where do we get off at?
We can get off the bus right behind Macy's.
There's a stop right next to the mall?
Yeah, it's right in the parking lot.
Does this bus really go to the mall?
It goes all the way there.
I know it does. I catch this bus a lot.
How long does it take for the bus to get there?
The bus ride is only thirty minutes or so.
Where do we get off the bus?
Right behind Macy's is a bus stop.
The stop is really at the mall?
It's in the middle of the parking lot.
That's perfect.
Are you sure that this bus will take us to Santa Anita mall?
Yes, it will.
You know that for a fact?
Yeah, I catch this bus all the time.
Is it a very long bus ride?
It's about thirty minutes long.
Do you know where we get off at?
There's a bus stop right behind Macy's.
Really, there's a bus stop right by the mall?
There's a bus stop in the mall parking lot.
That's convenient.
Asking for a Transfer
I need to get on another bus, but I have no more money.
Where'd the rest of your money for the bus go?
I spent it on a bag of chips.
Well, that was an intelligent thing to do.
You don't have any spare change?
How am I going to get home?
You should just ask the bus driver for a transfer.
How much does that cost?
It's free; just go ask for one.
No problem, just go ask.
I'm broke, and I have to catch another bus.
Why don't you have any money for another bus?
I got hungry and bought some chips.
That was smart.
Do you have any change I can use for the bus?
I don't know how I'm going to get home.
Get a transfer from the bus driver.
How much is a transfer?
It doesn't cost anything.
I don't have any more cash, and I have to get on another bus to get home.
Why don't you have any more money?
I wanted some chips at lunch today, so I spent it.
That was a bright idea.
Do you have some change I can borrow?
I don't have any change for you.
I need to get home.
Why don't you just ask the bus driver for a transfer?
I don't have money for a transfer.
Go ask for a transfer. They're free.
I'm glad you let me know.
Complaining about a Late Bus
Where is the bus?
I think it's running late.
It should've been here 30 minutes ago.
It should be coming soon.
It better, because I'm already late for work.
I can't stand riding the bus.
Me too, it's so unreliable.
It's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather.
Exactly.That's the worst part.
I think it's time we started driving.
Yes, I agree.
When is the bus going to get here?
It's obviously late.
It was scheduled to be here about thirty minutes ago.
I'm sure it'll be here in a little bit.
I hope so, because I'm running really late for work.
I hate having to take the bus every day.
So do I, you can never count on public transportation.
Exactly.
I really can't stand being at the bus stop in the heat and rain.
We're going to have to get a car of our own.
I couldn't agree with you more.
I want to get on the bus already.
It just isn't on time today.
I think it'll be here pretty soon.
I need to get to work, so it better.
I really do hate public transportation.
I agree, it's just never on time.
That's right.
I also hate having to stand at a bus stop in all kinds of weather.
Oh, that's the worst.
We need to get a car.
I completely agree with that.
Getting Off Too Early
Is this our bus stop?
I think this is it. Get off.
Dude, where are we at?
I thought this was the right stop.
It doesn't look right to me.
Did you make us get off early?
I think we did.
I should not have listened to you.
I really thought this was our stop.
Now we have to walk.
Maybe we should just wait for the next bus.
I'm not sure, is this our stop?
Yeah, get off the bus.
Do you have any idea where we are?
This can't be the right stop.
I don't think this is right.
We got off too early, didn't we?
Yeah, we did get off too early.
I should've just stayed on the bus.
I messed up.
Great, we have to walk now.
You want to wait for the next bus?
Are we supposed to get off right here?
I think so; hurry up and get off.
Where are we?
You said this was the right stop.
I think I was wrong.
Did we get off the bus too early?
I don't know; it kind of looks like we did.
Why did you tell me to get off?
I'm sorry. I thought this was our stop.
I really don't feel like walking.
We could always wait for the next bus to come.

Missing the Bus Stop
I think we have a little ways to go.
This bus ride is taking forever.
Did we miss our stop?
Didn't you say you knew where to get off the bus?
I don't know. We may have missed our stop.
Yeah, we did miss it.
I can't catch the bus with you anymore.
Sorry.
Do you know which stop we get off at?
We still have more to go, I think.
We've been on this bus for a while now.

Yeah, we definitely missed our stop.
That's the last time I get on a bus with you.
My bad.
On a Wrong Bus
So, where is this bus supposed to take us?
It should take us back up to Altadena.
Don't you know for sure?
I'm not really sure if it does or not.
Are you sure we got on the right bus?
I've never taken this bus, but I think it's the right one.
This place doesn't look like Altadena.
That's true, and we have been on this bus for a while.
Read one of the street signs or something.
Yikes! Temple City.
That's the last time I'm trusting you with the transportation.
My bad, but at least we know the right bus to take us back.
Do you even know where this bus is supposed to go?
It should take us all the way up to Altadena.
Don't you know?
I'm not positive if it does or not.
Is this the right bus, or not?
I have never been on this bus, but I'm sure it's the right one.
Where are we? This is not Altadena.
I know, and we've been on the bus forever.
Tell me what the street signs say.
Oh my gosh, that one says Temple City.
Next time, I'll look for the bus myself.
I know, but now I know the bus that'll take us back.
Are you sure you know where this bus goes?
It should go to Altadena.
What do you mean it should?
I'm not completely sure if it really does.
Dude, are we on the right bus?
I'm almost positive that this is the right one.
It doesn't look like we're on our way to Altadena.
We have been riding this bus for a long time.
What does that sign say?
I think it says Temple City.
Yup, I'm never trusting you with the bus schedules again.
I'm sorry. But at least we know which bus to catch to get back where we started.

Only about fifteen minutes.
Do you ride this bus often?
